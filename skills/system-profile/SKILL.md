# System Profile

Profile the specified target and summarize the results. Target: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

You are a profiling assistant. Based on the user's target, choose appropriate profiling strategies, **including writing instrumentation code when needed**, then run profiling, analyze results, and produce a summary.

### Step 1: Determine the profiling target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to understand what to profile. Examples:
- A Python script or module
- A running process (PID or service name)
- A specific function or code block
- An entire framework or system (e.g., "autogen", "vllm serving") — profile its end-to-end execution, identify bottlenecks across components
- "gpu" / "interconnect" / "memory" for focused profiling

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or unclear, ask the user.

### Step 2: Choose profiling methods

Select from external tools and/or code instrumentation as appropriate. Don't limit yourself to the examples below — use whatever makes sense for the target.

**External tools** (check availability first):
- CPU: `cProfile`, `py-spy`, `line_profiler`, `perf stat`, `/usr/bin/time -v`
- Memory: `tracemalloc`, `memory_profiler`, `memray`
- GPU: `nvidia-smi`, `nvidia-smi dmon`, `nvitop`, `torch.profiler`, `nsys`
- Interconnect: `nvidia-smi topo -m`, `nvidia-smi nvlink`, `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`
- System: `strace -c`, `iostat`, `vmstat`

**Code instrumentation** — when external tools are insufficient, write and insert profiling code into the target. Typical scenarios:
- Timing specific code blocks (wall time vs CPU time)
- Measuring CPU-GPU or GPU-GPU transfer size, frequency, and bandwidth
- Tracking memory allocation across CPU and GPU to detect redundancy
- Wrapping NCCL collectives to measure latency and throughput
- Adding CUDA event timing around kernels

Design the instrumentation based on what you observe in the code — don't use a fixed template.

### Step 3: Key dimensions to investigate

Depending on the target, focus on some or all of these:

**CPU overhead**
- Context switching (voluntary / involuntary)
- CPU utilization: ratio of CPU time to wall time
- Per-function execution time hotspots

**Memory overhead**
- CPU and GPU memory usage (allocated vs reserved vs peak)
- Redundant replication: same data living on both CPU and GPU
- Per-device allocation balance in multi-GPU setups

**Interconnect & communication**
- CPU-GPU transfer: frequency, per-transfer size, total volume, bandwidth achieved
- GPU-GPU transfer: P2P bandwidth, NVLink vs PCIe topology impact
- NCCL collectives: operation type, message size distribution, latency
- Communication-to-computation ratio

**GPU compute**
- SM utilization, kernel launch overhead
- Memory bandwidth utilization vs peak

### Step 4: Instrumentation guidelines

When inserting code into the target:
1. Read and understand the target code first
2. Prefer wrapping (decorator, context manager, standalone runner) over inline edits
3. If inline edits are necessary, mark them clearly (e.g., `# [PROFILE]` comments)
4. Minimize observer effect — don't instrument tight inner loops; sample instead
5. Collect results into a structured log, don't scatter print statements

### Step 5: Run profiling

1. Check available tools and hardware topology
2. Run the chosen methods, capture all output
3. Save artifacts (flamegraphs, traces, logs) to `./profile_output/`

### Step 6: Produce the report

**Part A — Profiling results** (structured tables by dimension, as applicable):
- CPU overhead table
- Memory overhead table (with redundancy column)
- Interconnect table (transfer type / frequency / size / latency / bandwidth)
- Hotspots / bottleneck identification
- Actionable recommendations ranked by expected impact

**Part B — Instrumentation changelog** (MANDATORY):
List every file that was modified or created for profiling purposes:

| File | Change type | What was added/modified | Line(s) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| ... | modified | ... | ... |
| ... | created | ... | — |

This allows the user to review and revert all instrumentation changes.
Offer to clean up (remove all instrumentation) when the user is done.
