# Grant Proposal: From Research Ideas to Fundable Application

> **Gemini overlay assurance:** `review_independence: cross-family` and `acceptance_status: accepted`.

Draft a grant proposal based on: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This skill turns validated research ideas into a structured, reviewer-ready grant proposal. It chains sub-skills into a grant-specific pipeline:

```
/research-lit → /novelty-check → [structure design] → [draft] → /research-review → [revise] → GRANT_PROPOSAL.md
  (survey)      (verify gap)     (aims + matrix)     (prose)    (panel review)     (fix)      (done!)
```

**This is a parallel branch, not part of the linear Workflow 1→1.5→2→3 pipeline.** After `/idea-discovery` produces validated ideas, the user can either:
- Go to `/experiment-bridge` → `/auto-review-loop` → `/paper-writing` (implement & publish)
- Go to `/grant-proposal` (write funding application first, then implement after funding)

```
                    ┌→ /experiment-bridge → /auto-review-loop → /paper-writing  (publish track)
/idea-discovery ────┤
                    └→ /grant-proposal → [get funded] → /experiment-bridge → ...  (funding track)
```

Grant proposals argue for **future work** (feasibility + potential), not completed work (results + claims). This skill handles the unique requirements of grant writing: narrative arc design, reviewer-facing structure, budget justification, timeline planning, and agency-specific formatting.

## Constants

- **GRANT_TYPE = `KAKENHI`** — Default grant type. Supported: `KAKENHI`, `NSF`, `NSFC`, `ERC`, `DFG`, `SNSF`, `ARC`, `NWO`, `GENERIC`. Override via argument (e.g., `/grant-proposal "topic — NSF"`).
- **GRANT_SUBTYPE = `auto`** — Sub-type within the grant agency. Examples: KAKENHI `Start-up`/`Wakate`/`Kiban-B`; NSFC `Youth`/`Excellent-Youth`/`Distinguished`/`Overseas`/`Key`; NSF `CAREER`/`CRII`/`Standard`. Auto-detected from argument or defaults to the most common sub-type.
- **REVIEWER_MODEL = `gemini-review`** — Gemini reviewer invoked through the local `gemini-review` MCP bridge for proposal review. Set `GEMINI_REVIEW_MODEL` if you need a specific Gemini model override.
- **OUTPUT_FORMAT = `markdown`** — Output format. Supported: `markdown`, `latex`. LaTeX uses grant-specific templates when available.
- **MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS = 2** — Maximum external review-revise cycles before finalizing.
- **OUTPUT_DIR = `grant-proposal/`** — Directory for generated proposal files.
- **LANGUAGE = `auto`** — Output language. Auto-detected from grant type: KAKENHI→Japanese, NSF→English, NSFC→Chinese, ERC→English, DFG→English (or German), SNSF→English, ARC→English, NWO→English. Override explicitly if needed.
- **AUTO_PROCEED = false** — At each checkpoint, **always wait for explicit user confirmation** before proceeding. Grant proposals require PI-specific judgment at every stage. Set `true` only if user explicitly requests fully autonomous mode.

> 💡 These are defaults. Override by telling the skill, e.g., `/grant-proposal "topic — NSF CAREER, latex output"` or `/grant-proposal "topic — NSFC Youth, language: English"`.

```

## State Persistence (Compact Recovery)

Grant proposal drafting is a long task that may trigger context compaction. Persist state to `grant-proposal/GRANT_STATE.json` after each phase:

```json
{
  "phase": 2,
  "grant_type": "KAKENHI",
  "grant_subtype": "Start-up",
  "language": "Japanese",
  "thread_id": "019cfcf4-...",
  "gap_statement": "...",
  "aims_count": 3,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-18T15:00:00"
}
```

**Write this file at the end of every phase.** On invocation, check for this file:
- If absent or `status: "completed"` → fresh start
- If `status: "in_progress"` and within 24h → **resume** from saved phase (read `GRANT_PROPOSAL.md` and `GRANT_REVIEW.md` to restore context)
- If older than 24h → fresh start (stale state)

On completion, set `"status": "completed"`.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Input Parsing & Context Gathering

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:

1. **Research direction/idea** — may reference existing files or be a freeform description
2. **Grant type** — detect from keywords (e.g., "科研費"→KAKENHI, "NSF"→NSF, "国自然"→NSFC, "基金"→NSFC)
3. **Grant sub-type** — detect from keywords (e.g., "Start-up", "若手", "青年", "CAREER", "优青", "海外优青")
4. **Overrides** — output format, language, review rounds

Then gather context from the project directory:

1. Read `idea-stage/IDEA_REPORT.md` if it exists (from `/idea-discovery`); fall back to `./IDEA_REPORT.md` if not found
2. Read `refine-logs/FINAL_PROPOSAL.md` if it exists (from `/research-refine`)
3. Read `refine-logs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` if it exists (from `/experiment-plan`)
4. Read `review-stage/AUTO_REVIEW.md` if it exists (from `/auto-review-loop` — prior review feedback is gold for grants); fall back to `./AUTO_REVIEW.md` if not found
5. Read `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` or `STORY.md` if they exist
6. Read any existing literature notes or survey documents
7. Scan for the user's publication list (e.g., `publications.md`, `cv.md`, `bio.md`, `CV.pdf`)
8. Check for `grant-proposal/GRANT_STATE.json` (resume from prior interrupted run)

If insufficient context exists:
- No research idea at all → suggest running `/idea-discovery` first
- No literature survey → will invoke `/research-lit` inline in Phase 1
- No publication list → leave PI qualification section with `[TODO: Add publications]` placeholders
- Has `review-stage/AUTO_REVIEW.md` → extract reviewer feedback and use it to strengthen the feasibility narrative

### Phase 1: Literature & Landscape Positioning

Invoke `/research-lit` to ground the proposal in real literature, then search for competing funded projects:

```
/research-lit "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**What this does:**
- Reuse existing surveys if `/research-lit` was already run and notes exist
- Otherwise invoke `/research-lit` for multi-source literature search (arXiv, Scholar, Zotero, local PDFs)
- Search for **funded projects** in the same area via WebSearch:
  - KAKENHI → KAKEN database (https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/)
  - NSF → NSF Award Search (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/)
  - NSFC → NSFC funded projects
  - Other agencies → general web search
- Identify competing groups and their recent publications
- Run `/novelty-check` on the proposed research direction to verify the gap is real:
  ```
  /novelty-check "[proposed gap statement]"
  ```
- Build the **gap statement** — the single most important sentence in the proposal:
  ```
  "Despite progress in [X], [specific gap] remains unaddressed because [reason].
  This proposal addresses this by [approach], which will [expected impact]."
  ```

**🚦 Checkpoint:** Present the landscape summary and gap statement to the user:

```
📚 Literature & landscape analysis complete:
- [key findings from literature]
- [competing funded projects found]
- Gap statement: "[the gap statement]"

Does this accurately capture the positioning? Should I adjust before designing the proposal structure?
```

**⛔ STOP HERE and wait for user response.** Do NOT auto-proceed unless AUTO_PROCEED=true was explicitly set by the user.

Options for the user:
- Reply **"go"** or **"ok"** → proceed to Phase 2 with current positioning
- Reply with **adjustments** (e.g., "focus more on X", "the gap should emphasize Y") → refine and re-present
- Reply **"stop"** → end the skill, save current progress to `grant-proposal/DRAFT_NOTES.md`

**State**: Write `GRANT_STATE.json` with `phase: 1` and the gap statement.

### Phase 2: Narrative Structure & Aims Design

Design the proposal's logical architecture before writing any prose.

#### 2.1 Define Specific Aims (2-4)

Each aim must satisfy:
- **Independently valuable** — if one aim fails, others still produce publishable results
- **Logically connected** — Aim 1 enables Aim 2, Aim 2 informs Aim 3
- **Concrete deliverables** — each aim maps to specific outputs (papers, datasets, tools, benchmarks)
- **Feasible within budget and timeline**

#### 2.2 Build Claims-Aims-Evidence Matrix

```markdown
| Aim | Key Claim | Preliminary Evidence | Proposed Validation | Risk Level | Deliverable |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------:|-------------|
| Aim 1 | [claim] | [pilot data, prior work] | [experiments] | LOW | [paper, dataset] |
| Aim 2 | [claim] | [theoretical basis] | [experiments] | MEDIUM | [paper, tool] |
```

#### 2.3 Design the Narrative Arc

Grant proposals follow a fundamentally different arc from papers:

```
Problem → Why Now → What We Propose → Why It Will Work → What We Will Deliver
         (not: Problem → Method → Results → Implications)
```

- **Problem**: What gap exists and why it matters (scientific + societal)
- **Why Now**: What recent developments make this the right time (new data, new methods, new need)
- **What We Propose**: The specific aims and approach
- **Why It Will Work**: Preliminary data, PI track record, team expertise, feasibility arguments
- **What We Will Deliver**: Concrete outputs, timeline, expected publications

#### 2.4 Timeline & Milestones

Design year-by-year (or quarter-by-quarter) plan:

```markdown
### Year 1
- Q1-Q2: [Aim 1 tasks]
- Q3-Q4: [Aim 1 completion + Aim 2 start]
- Expected outputs: [papers, datasets]

### Year 2
- Q1-Q2: [Aim 2 completion + Aim 3]
- Q3-Q4: [Aim 3 completion + synthesis]
- Expected outputs: [papers, tools, final report]
```

#### 2.5 Structural Review

Invoke `/research-review` to get critical feedback on the proposal structure before drafting:

```
/research-review "[GRANT_TYPE] [GRANT_SUBTYPE] proposal structure:
Gap: [gap statement]
Aims: [aims list with claims-evidence matrix]
Timeline: [timeline]
— reviewer persona: [GRANT_TYPE] review panelist"
```

**What this does:**
- Gemini acts as a grant review panelist (not a paper reviewer)
- Evaluates aims independence, narrative arc, risk identification, timeline realism
- Identifies the single biggest reviewer concern
- Provides actionable fixes ranked by severity

Apply structural feedback before proceeding to drafting.

**🚦 Checkpoint:** Present the proposal structure to the user:

```
🏗️ Proposal structure designed:
- Gap: [gap statement]
- Aim 1: [title] — Risk: LOW
- Aim 2: [title] — Risk: MEDIUM
- Aim 3: [title] — Risk: LOW
- Timeline: [summary]
- Reviewer feedback: [key points from Gemini]

Proceed to section drafting? Or adjust the structure?
```

**⛔ STOP HERE. This is the most critical checkpoint — the proposal structure determines everything downstream.**

Options for the user:
- Reply **"go"** or **"ok"** → proceed to Phase 3 (section drafting)
- Reply with **structural changes** (e.g., "merge Aim 2 and 3", "add an aim about X", "reduce to 2 aims") → redesign and re-present
- Reply **"back"** → return to Phase 1 to adjust the gap/positioning
- Reply **"stop"** → save current structure to `grant-proposal/DRAFT_NOTES.md`

**State**: Write `GRANT_STATE.json` with `phase: 2`, aims summary, and the completed reviewer `thread_id` if you ran the reviewer directly.

### Phase 3: Section Drafting

Draft each section according to the grant type template. Write **complete prose**, not outlines or placeholders.

**What this does:**
- Writes all required sections in the agency-specific language and tone
- Pulls content from `idea-stage/IDEA_REPORT.md`, FINAL_PROPOSAL.md, and literature notes
- Uses `/paper-illustration` for figure generation (if user requests)
- Leaves `[TODO]` only for PI-specific information, `[AMOUNT]` for budget figures
- Outputs `grant-proposal/GRANT_PROPOSAL.md`

#### Drafting Order (optimized for narrative coherence)

1. **Specific Aims / Research Objective** — the "abstract" of the grant. Write first, refine last.
2. **Background / Significance / State of the Art** — establish the problem and gap.
3. **Research Plan / Methods** — per aim, with feasibility arguments.
4. **Figures** — generate key diagrams (see below).
5. **Timeline & Milestones** — year-by-year deliverables.
6. **PI Qualification / Preparation Status** — track record, team, infrastructure.
7. **Budget Justification** — narrative only (leave dollar/yen amounts as `[AMOUNT]` placeholders).
8. **Broader Impacts / Societal Significance** — if required by the grant type.

#### Figure Generation

Grant proposals benefit greatly from clear diagrams. Generate the following figures using SVG or matplotlib (save to `grant-proposal/figures/`):

1. **全体構成図 / Overview Diagram** — Show the relationship between aims (Aim 1 → Aim 2 → Aim 3), shared resources (participants, stimuli, pipeline), and outputs. This is the single most important figure.
2. **実験パラダイム図 / Experimental Paradigm** — Visual schematic of each paradigm (stimulus timing, conditions, EEG recording).
3. **年次計画 / Timeline Gantt Chart** — Year-by-year (or H1/H2) milestones with deliverables.

For AI-generated publication-quality figures, invoke `/paper-illustration`:

```
/paper-illustration "Overview diagram showing [aims relationship + shared resources] for grant proposal"
```

For simpler diagrams (flowcharts, Gantt charts), generate clean SVG or matplotlib directly via code.

**🚦 Figure Checkpoint:** Before generating, ask which figures the user wants:

```
🎨 The following figures would strengthen this proposal:
1. 全体構成図 / Overview — aims relationship + shared resources
2. 実験パラダイム図 / Paradigm — stimulus timing + conditions
3. 年次計画 / Gantt — timeline with milestones

Which should I generate? (e.g., "1 and 3", "all", "skip")
```

**⛔ Wait for user response.** Generate only the requested figures.

#### Grant-Specific Drafting Guidelines

**KAKENHI:**
- Write in formal Japanese academic style (である調, not です/ます調)
- Use 「」for Japanese quotations, bold for emphasis
- Structure: 研究の学術的背景 → 研究期間内に何をどこまで明らかにするか → 本研究の学術的な特色・独創性
- Include explicit 年次計画 (yearly plan) with concrete milestones
- Emphasize 社会的意義 (societal significance)
- Reference related KAKEN-funded projects to show awareness of the field

**NSF:**
- Write in clear, direct English
- Use Aim-based structure with bold headings
- Preliminary data paragraphs for each Aim (with figure references)
- Broader Impacts must be concrete: specific outreach activities, broadening participation plans
- Include Results from Prior Support (if PI has prior NSF funding)

**NSFC:**
- Write in formal Chinese academic style
- 立项依据 must position work at 国际前沿 (international frontier)
- 创新性 section must list numbered innovation points (创新点)
- 研究基础 must cite PI's own publications (with IF and citations if possible)
- 可行性分析 must address: technical feasibility, team capability, time feasibility, equipment/conditions

**ERC:**
- Write a compelling "high-risk/high-gain" narrative
- Extended Synopsis must be self-contained and compelling
- Include Work Package table with deliverables and milestones
- Gantt chart (describe in text, or generate as figure)

#### For Each Section

1. **Pull relevant content** from `idea-stage/IDEA_REPORT.md`, FINAL_PROPOSAL.md, literature notes
2. **Write complete prose** — no `[TODO]` except for PI-specific information
3. **Include figure/table placeholders** where appropriate (e.g., `[Figure 1: System architecture]`)
4. **Cite references properly** — use citation keys, will build bibliography later
5. **Match the agency's tone and style** — formal Japanese for KAKENHI, direct English for NSF, etc.

### Phase 4: External Review

Invoke `/research-review` on the complete draft for grant-type-specific evaluation:

```
/research-review "Complete [GRANT_TYPE] [GRANT_SUBTYPE] proposal draft. Evaluate as a [GRANT_TYPE] review panelist using official criteria. [PASTE FULL PROPOSAL TEXT]"
```

**What this does:**
- Gemini acts as a grant review panelist
- Scores each section 1-5 using agency-specific criteria
- Identifies fatal flaws and recommends funding/revisions/rejection
- Provides ranked action items for improvement
- All feedback saved to `grant-proposal/GRANT_REVIEW.md`

> ⚠️ **External review fallback**: If `gemini-review` MCP is unavailable or Gemini credentials are missing, skip external review. Note "External review skipped — gemini-review unavailable." in `GRANT_REVIEW.md`. The proposal is still usable without external review.

If `/research-review` is invoked (preferred), it handles the external review internally. If you run the reviewer directly, use `mcp__gemini-review__review_start` for Round 1 and `mcp__gemini-review__review_reply_start` for follow-up rounds.

#### Round 1 (full draft review):

```
mcp__gemini-review__review_start:
  prompt: |
    Review this complete [GRANT_TYPE] [GRANT_SUBTYPE] proposal draft.

    Act as a [GRANT_TYPE] review panelist. Evaluate using the official criteria:

    [INSERT GRANT-TYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA — see Grant Type Specifications above]

    For each section:
    1. Score 1-5 (5 = excellent)
    2. Strongest aspect
    3. Most critical weakness
    4. Specific fix suggestion (actionable, not vague)

    Overall assessment:
    - Would you recommend funding? (Yes / Yes with revisions / No)
    - Single most impactful change to improve funding chances?
    - Any fatal flaws?

    [PASTE FULL PROPOSAL TEXT]
```

After this start call, immediately save the returned `jobId` and poll `mcp__gemini-review__review_status` with a bounded `waitSeconds` until `done=true`. Treat the completed status payload's `response` as the review output, and save the completed `threadId` in `GRANT_STATE.json` if you want to continue the same dialogue in Round 2.

#### Round 2+ (after revisions):

If MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS > 1 and revisions were applied:

```
mcp__gemini-review__review_reply_start:
  threadId: [saved completed threadId from Round 1]
  prompt: |
    [Round N review of revised [GRANT_TYPE] [GRANT_SUBTYPE] proposal]

    Since your last review, I have applied the following changes:
    1. [Change 1]: [what was done]
    2. [Change 2]: [what was done]
    3. [Change 3]: [what was done]

    Please re-evaluate. Same format: section scores, overall assessment, remaining weaknesses.
    Focus on whether the CRITICAL and MAJOR issues from Round 1 have been adequately addressed.

    [PASTE REVISED PROPOSAL TEXT]
```

After this start call, immediately save the returned `jobId` and poll `mcp__gemini-review__review_status` with a bounded `waitSeconds` until `done=true`. Treat the completed status payload's `response` as the updated review output.

### Phase 5: Revision & Output

#### 5.1 Apply Reviewer Feedback

Parse reviewer feedback into severity levels:
- **CRITICAL** — fatal flaws that would lead to rejection. Fix immediately.
- **MAJOR** — significant weaknesses. Fix before submission.
- **MINOR** — suggestions for improvement. Fix if time allows.

Implement CRITICAL and MAJOR fixes. If MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS > 1, re-submit for another round via `send_input`.

#### 5.2 Generate Output

**Markdown output** (default):

```
grant-proposal/
├── GRANT_PROPOSAL.md          # Complete proposal, all sections
├── GRANT_REVIEW.md            # Review history and reviewer feedback
├── GRANT_STATE.json           # State persistence file
├── figures/                   # Generated diagrams (if any)
└── references.bib             # Bibliography (if citations were used)
```

**LaTeX output** (when OUTPUT_FORMAT = latex):

```

#### 5.3 Final Checks

Before declaring done:

- [ ] All sections required by the grant type are present and complete
- [ ] Gap statement is clear and appears early in the proposal
- [ ] Each aim is independently valuable and logically connected
- [ ] Timeline includes concrete yearly milestones and deliverables
- [ ] PI qualification section has content (or clear `[TODO]` placeholders)
- [ ] Budget justification uses `[AMOUNT]` placeholders (no fabricated numbers)
- [ ] Language matches the grant type (Japanese for KAKENHI, Chinese for NSFC, etc.)
- [ ] No leftover `[TODO]` markers except for PI-specific information
- [ ] References are real (no hallucinated citations)
- [ ] Review feedback has been addressed (CRITICAL and MAJOR items)

**🚦 Final Checkpoint:** Present the completed proposal summary:

```
📝 Grant proposal draft complete:
- Type: [GRANT_TYPE] [GRANT_SUBTYPE]
- Language: [language]
- Aims: [N] aims covering [summary]
- Timeline: [N] years
- Review score: [summary from Gemini]
- Output: grant-proposal/GRANT_PROPOSAL.md

Files saved to grant-proposal/. Please review and customize:
1. PI qualification section (add your publications and track record)
2. Budget amounts (replace [AMOUNT] placeholders)
3. Any [TODO] markers for personal information

What would you like to do next?
- "figures" → generate proposal diagrams
- "review again" → run another round of external review
- "latex" → convert to LaTeX format
- "done" → finalize
```

## Output Protocols

> Follow these shared protocols for all output files:
> - **[Output Versioning Protocol](../../shared-references/output-versioning.md)** — write timestamped file first, then copy to fixed name
> - **[Output Manifest Protocol](../../shared-references/output-manifest.md)** — log every output to MANIFEST.md
> - **[Output Language Protocol](../../shared-references/output-language.md)** — respect the project's language setting

## Key Rules

- **Large file handling**: If the Write tool fails due to file size, immediately retry using Bash (`cat << 'EOF' > file`) to write in chunks. Do NOT ask the user for permission — just do it silently.

- **Do NOT fabricate budget amounts.** Generate narrative budget justification only. Leave specific dollar/yen/yuan/euro amounts as `[AMOUNT]` placeholders for the user to fill in.
- **Do NOT fabricate PI information.** If no publication list is available, leave `[TODO: Add publications]` placeholders. Never invent papers, grants, or credentials.
- **Do NOT hallucinate citations.** Use references from literature survey. Mark uncertain citations with `[VERIFY]`.
- **Grant ≠ paper.** A grant argues for future work (feasibility + potential). A paper argues for completed work (results + claims). Write accordingly — emphasize "what we will do" and "why it will work", not "what we found."
- **Aims must be independently valuable.** If Aim 2 fails, Aim 1 and Aim 3 should still produce publishable results.
- **Preliminary data de-risks.** Include any pilot results, existing datasets, or prior publications that demonstrate feasibility.
- **Reviewer-facing structure.** Bold key sentences. Use numbered lists for clarity. Make the reviewer's job easy.
- **Cultural norms matter.** KAKENHI expects 社会的意義; NSF expects Broader Impacts; NSFC expects 国际前沿 positioning. Missing these is a red flag for reviewers.
- **Feishu notifications are optional.** If `~/.codex/feishu.json` exists, send `checkpoint` at each phase transition and `pipeline_done` at final output. If absent, skip silently.

## Parameter Pass-Through

Parameters can be passed inline with `—` separator. They flow to sub-skills when invoked:

```
/grant-proposal "topic — KAKENHI Start-up, sources: zotero, arxiv download: true"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description | Passed to |

## Composing with Other Skills

### Sub-skills used by this skill

| Sub-skill | Phase | Purpose |
|-----------|:-----:|---------|
| `/research-lit` | 1 | Literature survey (if not already done) |
| `/novelty-check` | 1 | Verify the gap is real |
| `/research-review` | 2, 4 | Structural review + full draft review |
| `/paper-illustration` | 3 | Generate proposal figures (optional) |

### Funding Track (this skill's primary use case)

```
/idea-discovery "direction"              ← Workflow 1: find validated ideas
/research-refine "idea"                  ← sharpen the method
/grant-proposal "idea — KAKENHI"         ← this skill: write the grant proposal
                                          ← [submit & get funded]
/experiment-bridge                       ← implement experiments with funding
/auto-review-loop "results"              ← Workflow 2: iterate until submission-ready
/paper-writing                           ← Workflow 3: write the paper
```

### Publish Track (skip this skill)

```
/idea-discovery → /experiment-bridge → /auto-review-loop → /paper-writing → submit
```
