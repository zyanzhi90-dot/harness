# Training Check

You are now in **interactive watch** / 交互式训练监控模式.

Keep the current session open and report directly in the current terminal. The user is watching this terminal for updates. By default, run a training health check every 30 minutes, output a concise but complete analysis report after each check, state the next check time, then continue monitoring.

This skill checks training **quality**, not basic process health. Process health checks such as whether a tmux session exists or whether the GPU is idle can be handled by watchdog-style tooling; this skill focuses on whether the run is still worth continuing.

## Inputs To Establish First

Before the first check, identify or ask for the minimum monitoring context:

- WandB run path or URL, if available.
- Fallback log path, SSH command, or local command for reading recent training logs.
- Training target, expected baseline, and key metrics that define success.
- How the training was launched, so it can be stopped if needed.
- Project notes path for recording decisions and evidence.

If a source is unavailable, say so clearly and continue with the available source. If both WandB and fallback logs are unreachable, report the connectivity issue, classify the round as `WAIT`, and check again later. Do not infer that training is bad only because data is unreachable.

## Per-Round Check

Every round, read WandB first when configured. If WandB is unreachable, read the fallback logs. Inspect at least:

- Training loss trend over recent checkpoints or steps.
- Eval metrics and whether they improve, flatten, or degrade against baseline.
- NaN or Inf in loss, gradients, activations, or logged metrics.
- Sudden loss spikes, divergence, or repeated failed evaluations.
- Learning rate schedule behavior.
- Gradient norm, if logged.
- Plateau patterns that suggest the run is no longer useful.

Output one report in the current terminal with this structure:

```text
## Training Check - <local timestamp>

- Data source: wandb_ok | log_fallback | unreachable
- Run: <wandb run or training identifier>
- Recent metrics: <loss/eval/lr/grad summary>
- Anomalies: <NaN/Inf/spike/divergence/plateau findings>
- Evidence: <WandB URL, log lines, metric values, or files inspected>
- Decision: CONTINUE | WAIT | STOP
- Reason: <why this decision is justified>
- Next check: <local timestamp, normally 30 minutes later unless ending>
```

Use the decisions as follows:

| Decision | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `CONTINUE` | Run looks healthy enough to keep training. | Keep monitoring and check again in 30 minutes. |
| `WAIT` | Evidence is inconclusive, noisy, too early, or temporarily unreachable. | Do not stop training; keep monitoring and check again later. |
| `STOP` | Training is clearly problematic or no longer worth continuing. | Stop the training task, save evidence, write notes, output final summary, and end monitoring. |

## Stop Behavior

When the decision is `STOP`:

- Stop the training task.
- If the context contains `stop_command`, run `stop_command` first.
- If no `stop_command` is available, choose the appropriate stop action from how the training was launched, such as stopping the relevant tmux session, local process, remote process, scheduler job, or notebook job.
- Save evidence: WandB URL, key metrics, relevant log snippets, files inspected, and the reason for stopping.
- Append a project note for debugging and future analysis.
- Output `FINAL_SUMMARY` in the terminal.
- End the interactive monitoring loop.

Never stop on the first sign of ordinary metric noise. Look for sustained trends, hard failures, or clear divergence. Always preserve enough evidence for a later agent or human to understand why the run was stopped.

## Interactive Loop Guidance

- The normal interval is 30 minutes.
- If a round is `CONTINUE`, announce the next check time and wait until then.
- If a round is `WAIT`, explain what evidence is missing or noisy and check again later. Use a shorter interval only when the run looks suspicious but not yet stop-worthy.
- If an anomaly recovers, say so explicitly and continue monitoring.
- Keep the user-facing report short enough to read in a terminal, but include concrete metric values and evidence paths.
