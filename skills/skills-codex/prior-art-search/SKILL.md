# Prior Art Search

Search patents and literature for prior art relevant to: **$ARGUMENTS**

Adapted from `/research-lit` for patent-specific searching.

## Constants

- `MAX_PATENT_RESULTS = 20` — Maximum patent documents to analyze in detail
- `MAX_PAPER_RESULTS = 15` — Maximum academic papers to analyze in detail
- `SEARCH_YEARS = 10` — How many years back to search
- `PATENT_DATABASES = "google-patents, espacenet"` — Patent databases to search

## Inputs

Read the invention description from:
1. `$ARGUMENTS` if it contains technical details
2. `patent/INVENTION_BRIEF.md` if it exists
3. `INVENTION_BRIEF.md` if it exists at project root

## Shared References

Load `../shared-references/prior-art-databases.md` for search strategy templates and IPC/CPC classification guidance.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Search Concepts

From the invention description, identify:
1. **Core inventive concept**: The primary technical contribution (1-2 sentences)
2. **Technical problem**: What problem it solves
3. **Key technical features**: 4-6 specific technical elements that define the invention
4. **IPC/CPC classes**: Predict relevant classification codes (e.g., G06N, G06F)

### Step 2: Patent Search

For EACH search concept, search via:

**Google Patents** (via WebSearch):
```
WebSearch: "site:patents.google.com [keywords]"
WebSearch: "[keywords] patent"
```
- Try primary keywords + technical problem keywords
- Search in English regardless of target jurisdiction
- For CN inventions, also search Chinese keywords via WebSearch

**Espacenet** (via WebFetch):
- WebFetch worldwide.espacenet.com/search results for key queries
- Search by predicted IPC/CPC classes

**Assignee/Inventor Search**:
- If known companies/universities work in this area, search their patent portfolios
- WebSearch: "[assignee name] patent [technical area]"

For each potentially relevant patent found:
- WebFetch the patent page to extract: title, abstract, representative claims, filing date, assignee, current status
- Record IPC/CPC classification codes

### Step 3: Academic Literature Search

Search the same concepts in academic databases:

1. **Google Scholar** (via WebSearch): `WebSearch "[keywords] site:scholar.google.com"`
2. **arXiv** (via `/arxiv` if available, or WebSearch): Search for preprints
3. **Semantic Scholar** (via `/semantic-scholar` if API key set, or WebSearch)

For each relevant paper found:
- Extract title, authors, venue, year, key contribution

### Step 4: Classification and Analysis

For each reference found, assess:

1. **Relevance**: How closely does it relate to the invention?
2. **Overlap Risk**: Does it disclose the same or similar technical solution?
   - HIGH: Anticipates one or more claim elements
   - MEDIUM: Discloses a related but different approach
   - LOW: Same general field, different approach
3. **Relationship**: Is it anticipating, relevant, or merely background?

Organize results by IPC/CPC classification to see the technical landscape.

### Step 5: Freedom-to-Operate Assessment (Preliminary)

Based on the search results:
- Identify patents with claims that potentially cover the invention
- Note any expired patents (public domain)
- Flag areas where claim scope overlap is significant

**Disclaimer**: This is a preliminary assessment only. A professional freedom-to-operate analysis by a patent attorney is recommended before filing.

### Step 6: Output

Write `patent/PRIOR_ART_REPORT.md` with:

```markdown
## Prior Art Search Report

### Invention Summary
[1-2 sentence description of the searched invention]

### Search Strategy
- Keywords used: [...]
- IPC/CPC classes searched: [...]
- Databases searched: Google Patents, Espacenet, Google Scholar, arXiv
- Date range: [year] to present

### Patent References Found

| # | Patent No. | Title | Date | Assignee | IPC/CPC | Key Teaching | Overlap Risk |
|---|-----------|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | CN... / US... | [title] | [date] | [assignee] | [codes] | [2-3 sentences] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

### Non-Patent Literature Found

| # | Reference | Title | Authors/Venue | Year | Key Contribution | Relevance |
|---|-----------|-------|--------------|------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | [DOI/link] | [title] | [authors] | [year] | [1-2 sentences] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

### Prior Art Landscape
[Organized by technical approach or IPC class, not just chronological]

### Freedom-to-Operate Preliminary Assessment
[Which existing patents might block the invention? What is the risk level?]

### Recommendations
- Suggested claim scope adjustments based on prior art
- Areas where novelty appears strongest
- References to watch during prosecution
```

## Key Rules

- Never fabricate patent numbers or citations. Mark uncertain references with `[VERIFY]`.
- Search in English AND the target jurisdiction language (Chinese for CN).
- Patent prior art includes everything published before the priority date, not just patents.
- Academic papers are valid prior art for both novelty and inventive step.
- Include expired patents -- they are public domain but still relevant for novelty.
