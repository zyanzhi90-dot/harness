# Paper Poster (DEPRECATED → /paper-poster-html)

This skill is retired. The LaTeX/tcbposter pipeline it described produced posters with
unbounded color palettes, no real paper figures, and no print-canvas verification, and
has been replaced by the measurement-gated HTML/CSS pipeline.

**Immediately proceed with `/paper-poster-html`**, passing through all of the user's
arguments unchanged. Do not attempt the legacy LaTeX flow.

The full legacy implementation remains available in git history
(`git log -- skills/skills-codex/paper-poster/SKILL.md`) if a venue ever mandates
LaTeX poster source — none is known to.
