# Workflow 3: Paper Writing Pipeline

> The pipeline still completes when all mandatory audits are green, but the
> Final Report must say `Submission-ready: provisional`; only cross-family or
> deterministic accepted audit coverage may say `yes`.

Orchestrate a complete paper writing workflow for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This skill chains five sub-skills into a single automated pipeline:

```
/paper-plan → /paper-figure → /paper-write → /paper-compile → /auto-paper-improvement-loop
  (outline)     (plots)        (LaTeX)        (build PDF)       (review & polish ×2)
```

Each phase builds on the previous one's output. The final deliverable is a polished, reviewed `paper/` directory with LaTeX source and compiled PDF.

In this hybrid pack, the pipeline itself is unchanged, but `paper-plan` and `paper-write` use Orchestra-adapted shared references for stronger story framing and prose guidance.

## Constants

- **VENUE = `ICLR`** — Target venue. Options: `ICLR`, `NeurIPS`, `ICML`, `CVPR`, `ACL`, `AAAI`, `ACM`, `IEEE_JOURNAL` (IEEE Transactions / Letters), `IEEE_CONF` (IEEE conferences). Affects style file, page limit, citation format.
- **MAX_IMPROVEMENT_ROUNDS = 2** — Number of review→fix→recompile rounds in the improvement loop.
- **REVIEWER_MODEL = `gpt-5.6-sol`** — Model used via Codex MCP for plan review, figure review, writing review, and improvement loop.
- **AUTO_PROCEED = true** — Auto-continue between phases. Set `false` to pause and wait for user approval after each phase.
- **HUMAN_CHECKPOINT = false** — When `true`, the improvement loop (Phase 5) pauses after each round's review to let you see the score and provide custom modification instructions. When `false` (default), the loop runs fully autonomously. Passed through to `/auto-paper-improvement-loop`.
- **ILLUSTRATION = `figurespec`** — Architecture/illustration generator for Phase 2b: `figurespec` (default, deterministic JSON→SVG via `/figure-spec`, best for architecture/workflow/topology), `gemini` (AI-generated via `/paper-illustration`, best for qualitative method illustrations; needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`), `mermaid` (Mermaid syntax via `/mermaid-diagram`, free, best for flowcharts), or `false` (skip Phase 2b, manual only).

> Override inline: `/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md" — venue: NeurIPS, illustration: gemini, human checkpoint: true`
> IEEE example: `/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md" — venue: IEEE_JOURNAL`

## Inputs

This pipeline accepts one of:

1. **`NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`** (best) — structured research narrative with claims, experiments, results, figures
2. **Research direction + experiment results** — the skill will help draft the narrative first
3. **Existing `PAPER_PLAN.md`** — skip Phase 1, start from **Phase 1.5** (the contract negotiation still runs; only resuming a genuine pre-1.5 legacy run may skip it, and then Phase 6.0's row 0 records "no contract")

The more detailed the input (especially figure descriptions and quantitative results), the better the output.

## Pipeline

### Phase 0: Assurance Setup

Resolve the active `assurance` level and persist it so Phase 6's external
verifier reads the same value. **Run once at pipeline start, before Phase 1.**

**Resolution order** (first match wins):

1. Explicit `— assurance: draft | submission` in `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Derived from `— effort:`
   - `lite` / `balanced` → `draft` (default, **zero change from current behavior**)
   - `max` / `beast` → `submission`
3. Default: `draft`

**Action:**

```bash
mkdir -p paper/.aris
echo "<resolved-level>" > paper/.aris/assurance.txt   # draft or submission
```

**What each level does downstream:**

- **`draft`** — Existing behavior. Audits run only when their content detector
  matches (Phase 4.5 / 4.7 / 5.5 / 5.8). Missing artifacts are non-blocking.
  Silent-skip allowed.
- **`submission`** — The four mandatory audits (proof-checker,
  paper-claim-audit, citation-audit, kill-argument) are treated as load-bearing gates. Each
  sub-audit must emit its JSON artifact (PASS / WARN / FAIL / NOT_APPLICABLE /
  BLOCKED / ERROR) — never silent-skip. Phase 6 runs
  `verify_paper_audits.sh` (canonical name; resolved per
  `shared-references/integration-contract.md` §2); a non-zero exit blocks the Final Report.

**Escape hatch:** a user wanting the old "beast = depth-only, no audit gate"
can pass `— effort: beast, assurance: draft` explicitly. Legal but
discouraged for actual submissions. See
`shared-references/assurance-contract.md` for the full contract.

**Announce the resolved level in-line before Phase 1:**

```
📋 Assurance: <level> (derived from effort: <effort>)
   <either "current behavior, no audit gate" OR "mandatory audits gated by verify_paper_audits.sh (resolved per integration-contract §2)">
```

### Phase 1: Paper Plan

Invoke `/paper-plan` to create the structural outline:

```
/paper-plan "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**What this does:**
- Parse NARRATIVE_REPORT.md for claims, evidence, and figure descriptions
- Build a **Claims-Evidence Matrix** — every claim maps to evidence, every experiment supports a claim
- Design section structure (5-8 sections depending on paper type)
- Plan figure/table placement with data sources
- Scaffold citation structure
- GPT-5.6-Sol reviews the plan for completeness

**Output:** `PAPER_PLAN.md` with section plan, figure plan, citation scaffolding.

**Checkpoint:** Present the plan summary to the user.

```
📐 Paper plan complete:
- Title: [proposed title]
- Sections: [N] ([list])
- Figures: [N] auto-generated + [M] manual
- Target: [VENUE], [PAGE_LIMIT] pages

Shall I proceed with figure generation?
```

- **User approves** (or AUTO_PROCEED=true) → proceed to Phase 1.5.
- **User requests changes** → adjust plan and re-present.

### Phase 1.5: Negotiated Acceptance Contract (before any writing)

The plan says what the paper will contain; the CONTRACT says what "done" means
— a checklist of testable assertions, negotiated ADVERSARIALLY before the first
section is written, and graded at the end. (The plan is the boundary; the
contract is what gets graded.)

1. **Executor proposes.** From `PAPER_PLAN.md` + `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`, draft
   `PAPER_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md`: **10–20 testable assertions** — every
   headline claim has a named evidence source; every abstract number traces to
   a results file; scope qualifiers the title/abstract must carry; figures
   that must exist and what each must show; section-level completeness; venue
   constraints. Each assertion must be CHECKABLE by reading the final PDF +
   results files — no vibes ("writing is clear" is not an assertion; "every
   acronym is defined at first use" is). Fewer than ~10 rubber-stamps; beyond
   ~20 stalls on trivia.

2. **Reviewer pushes back.** Spawn a FRESH reviewer agent (xhigh reasoning)
   pointed at `PAPER_PLAN.md`, `PAPER_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md`, and the evidence
   inventory (`NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` + results paths). Its brief: push back on
   the contract, not the plan — (a) untestable/vibes assertions → demand a
   checkable rewrite; (b) missing assertions (uncovered claims, untraced
   numbers, foreseeable overclaims with no scope assertion); (c) assertions
   the evidence cannot possibly satisfy — flag now, not after writing. It must
   end with exactly one line: `CONTRACT_ACCEPTED: yes` or
   `CONTRACT_ACCEPTED: no` plus numbered revision demands. A reply with a
   missing or malformed verdict line is treated as `no`; request a corrected
   verdict as a follow-up — the correction exchange does not consume a round.

3. **Iterate.** On `no`, revise per the demands and resubmit as a follow-up in
   the SAME reviewer thread (the negotiation is one conversation). **Max 3
   rounds.**

4. **Fallback — never stall the pipeline.** Round 3 still `no` → record the
   unresolved demands verbatim in a "## Disputed" section and mark
   `status: contested`. A contested contract is precisely the "insert a human
   when the CONTRACT is wrong" trigger, so it OVERRIDES `AUTO_PROCEED` for this
   one decision: pause and present the dispute for a human tie-break. If no
   human responds (unattended run), proceed — but a contested contract caps the
   outcome: Phase 6 gates on the UNDISPUTED assertions and the Final Report
   must set `Submission-ready: no` with the dispute reproduced verbatim; the
   tie-break happens when the human returns.

**Output:** `PAPER_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md` (`status: accepted | contested`,
round count, reviewer thread/agent id). FROZEN once accepted — Phases 2–5
implement against it, never edit it; a genuinely-wrong assertion is a contract
question for a checkpoint, not a silent rewrite.

**Boundary:** the claim audit (Phases 4.7 / 5.5) stays zero-context — the
contract is a WRITER-side gate, never passed to the claim auditor (two
different nets by design).

### Phase 2: Figure Generation

Invoke `/paper-figure` to generate data-driven plots and tables:

```
/paper-figure "PAPER_PLAN.md"
```

**What this does:**
- Read figure plan from PAPER_PLAN.md
- Generate matplotlib/seaborn plots from JSON/CSV data
- Generate LaTeX comparison tables
- Create `figures/latex_includes.tex` for easy insertion
- GPT-5.6-Sol reviews figure quality and captions

**Output:** `figures/` directory with PDFs, generation scripts, and LaTeX snippets.

> **Scope:** `paper-figure` covers data plots and comparison tables. Architecture diagrams, pipeline figures, and method illustrations are handled in Phase 2b below.

#### Phase 2b: Architecture & Illustration Generation

**Skip this step entirely if `illustration: false`.**

If the paper plan includes architecture diagrams, pipeline figures, audit cascades, or method illustrations, invoke the appropriate generator based on the `illustration` parameter:

**When `illustration: figurespec`** (default) — invoke `/figure-spec`:
```
/figure-spec "[architecture/workflow description from PAPER_PLAN.md]"
```
- Deterministic JSON → SVG vector rendering (editable, reproducible)
- Best for: system architecture, workflow pipelines, audit cascades, layered topology
- Output: `figures/*.svg` + `figures/*.pdf` (via rsvg-convert) + `figures/specs/*.json`
- No external API, runs fully local

**When `illustration: gemini`** — invoke `/paper-illustration`:
```
/paper-illustration "[method description from PAPER_PLAN.md or NARRATIVE_REPORT.md]"
```
- Claude plans → Gemini optimizes → Nano Banana Pro renders → Claude reviews (score ≥ 9)
- Best for: qualitative method illustrations, natural-style diagrams, result grids
- Output: `figures/ai_generated/*.png`
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

**When `illustration: mermaid`** — invoke `/mermaid-diagram`:
```
/mermaid-diagram "[method description from PAPER_PLAN.md]"
```
- Generates Mermaid syntax diagrams (flowchart, sequence, class, state, etc.)
- Best for: lightweight flowcharts, state machines, simple sequence diagrams
- Output: `figures/*.mmd` + `figures/*.png`
- Free, no API key needed

**When `illustration: false`** — skip entirely. All non-data figures must be created manually (draw.io, Figma, TikZ) and placed in `figures/` before Phase 3.

**Choosing the right mode:**
- Formal architecture / workflow / topology figures → `figurespec` (default)
- Method concept illustrations with natural style → `gemini`
- Quick flowchart / state machine → `mermaid`
- Full manual control → `false`

These are complementary, not mutually exclusive: you can run multiple generators for different figures in the same paper by re-invoking with different `illustration` overrides.

**Checkpoint:** List generated vs manual figures.

```
📊 Figures complete:
- Data plots (auto, Phase 2): [list]
- Architecture/illustrations (auto, Phase 2b, mode=<illustration>): [list]
- Manual (need your input): [list]
- LaTeX snippets: figures/latex_includes.tex

[If manual figures needed]: Please add them to figures/ before I proceed.
[If all auto]: Shall I proceed with LaTeX writing?
```

### Phase 3: LaTeX Writing

Invoke `/paper-write` to generate section-by-section LaTeX:

```
/paper-write "PAPER_PLAN.md"
```

**What this does:**
- Write each section following the plan, with proper LaTeX formatting
- Insert figure/table references from `figures/latex_includes.tex`
- Build `references.bib` from citation scaffolding
- Clean stale files from previous section structures
- Automated bib cleaning (remove uncited entries)
- De-AI polish (remove "delve", "pivotal", "landscape"...)
- GPT-5.6-Sol reviews each section for quality

**Output:** `paper/` directory with `main.tex`, `sections/*.tex`, `references.bib`, `math_commands.tex`.

**Checkpoint:** Report section completion.

```
✍️ LaTeX writing complete:
- Sections: [N] written ([list])
- Citations: [N] unique keys in references.bib
- Stale files cleaned: [list, if any]

Shall I proceed with compilation?
```

### Phase 4: Compilation

Invoke `/paper-compile` to build the PDF:

```
/paper-compile "paper/"
```

**What this does:**
- `latexmk -pdf` with automatic multi-pass compilation
- Auto-fix common errors (missing packages, undefined refs, BibTeX syntax)
- Up to 3 compilation attempts
- Post-compilation checks: undefined refs, page count, font embedding
- Precise page verification via `pdftotext`
- Stale file detection

**Output:** `paper/main.pdf`

**Checkpoint:** Report compilation results.

```
🔨 Compilation complete:
- Status: SUCCESS
- Pages: [X] (main body) + [Y] (references) + [Z] (appendix)
- Within page limit: YES/NO
- Undefined references: 0
- Undefined citations: 0

Shall I proceed with the improvement loop?
```

### Phase 4.5: Proof Verification (theory papers only)

**Skip this phase if the paper contains no theorems, lemmas, or proofs.**

```
if paper contains \begin{theorem} or \begin{lemma} or \begin{proof}:
    Run /proof-checker "paper/"
    This invokes GPT-5.6-Sol xhigh to:
    - Verify all proof steps (hypothesis discharge, interchange justification, etc.)
    - Check for logic gaps, quantifier errors, missing domination conditions
    - Attempt counterexamples on key lemmas
    - Generate PROOF_AUDIT.md with issue list + severity

    If FATAL or CRITICAL issues found:
        Fix before proceeding to improvement loop
    If only MAJOR/MINOR:
        Proceed, improvement loop may address remaining issues
else:
    skip — no proofs, no action
```

### Phase 4.7: Paper Claim Audit

**Skip if no result files exist (e.g., survey/position papers with no experiments).**

```
if results/*.json or results/*.csv or outputs/*.json exist:
    Run /paper-claim-audit "paper/"
    Fresh zero-context reviewer compares every number in the paper
    against raw result files. Catches rounding inflation, best-seed
    cherry-pick, config mismatch, delta errors.

    If FAIL:
        Fix mismatched numbers before improvement loop
    If WARN:
        Proceed, but flag for manual verification
else:
    skip — no experimental results to verify
```

### Phase 5: Auto Improvement Loop

Invoke `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` to polish the paper:

```
/auto-paper-improvement-loop "paper/"
```

**What this does (2 rounds):**

**Round 1:** GPT-5.6-Sol xhigh reviews the full paper → identifies CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR issues → Claude Code implements fixes → recompile → save `main_round1.pdf`

**Round 2:** GPT-5.6-Sol xhigh re-reviews with conversation context → identifies remaining issues → Claude Code implements fixes → recompile → save `main_round2.pdf`

**Typical improvements:**
- Fix assumption-model mismatches
- Soften overclaims to match evidence
- Add missing interpretations and notation
- Strengthen limitations section
- Add theory-aligned experiments if needed

**Output:** Three PDFs for comparison + `PAPER_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`.

**Format check** (included in improvement loop Step 8): After final recompilation, auto-detect and fix overfull hboxes (content exceeding margins), verify page count vs venue limit, and ensure compact formatting. Location-aware thresholds: any main-body overfull blocks completion regardless of size; appendix overfulls block only if >10pt; bibliography overfulls block only if >20pt.

### Phase 5.5: Final Paper Claim Audit (MANDATORY submission gate)

After `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` finishes, **rerun** `/paper-claim-audit` before the final report whenever the paper contains numeric claims and machine-readable raw result files exist.

Use the same detectors as Phase 4.7:
- numeric-claim regex over `paper/main.tex` and `paper/sections/*.tex`
- raw-evidence file search in `results/`, `outputs/`, `experiments/`, and `figures/` for `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`

This phase is **mandatory** if both detectors are positive. It blocks the final report.
If numeric claims exist but no raw result files are found, stop and warn the user before declaring the paper complete.
If no numeric claims exist, skip.

```bash
NUMERIC_CLAIMS=$(rg -n -e '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?\s*(%|\\%|±|\\pm|x|×)' \
  -e '(accuracy|BLEU|F1|AUC|mAP|top-1|top-5|error|loss|perplexity|speedup|improvement)' \
  paper/main.tex paper/sections 2>/dev/null || true)

RAW_RESULT_FILES=$(find results outputs experiments figures -type f \
  \( -name '*.json' -o -name '*.jsonl' -o -name '*.csv' -o -name '*.tsv' -o -name '*.yaml' -o -name '*.yml' \) 2>/dev/null | head -200)

if [ -n "$NUMERIC_CLAIMS" ] && [ -n "$RAW_RESULT_FILES" ]; then
    Run /paper-claim-audit "paper/"
    If FAIL:
        Fix mismatched numbers before the final report
elif [ -n "$NUMERIC_CLAIMS" ]; then
    Stop and warn: the paper contains numeric claims but no raw evidence files were found
fi
```

**Empirical motivation:** in a real submission run, the final paper claimed a narrower experiment grid than the raw JSON actually contained, and a tolerance value was rounded down past the actual relative error. Both were caught only after manual `paper-claim-audit` invocation in the final round; the improvement loop did not detect them.

### Phase 5.8: Citation Audit (submission gate)

After the final paper-claim-audit passes, run `/citation-audit` to verify every `\cite{...}` along three axes: existence, metadata correctness, and context appropriateness. This is the fourth and final layer of the evidence-and-claim assurance stack (`experiment-audit` → `result-to-claim` → `paper-claim-audit` → `citation-audit`).

```
if paper/references.bib (or paper.bib) exists and contains entries cited from sec/*.tex:
    Run /citation-audit "paper/"
    Fresh Codex reviewer (`spawn_agent`, same-family provisional) with web/DBLP/arXiv lookup
    verifies each entry:
      (i)   EXISTENCE — paper resolves at claimed arXiv ID / DOI / venue
      (ii)  METADATA — author names, year, venue, title match canonical sources
      (iii) CONTEXT — cited paper actually establishes the claim it supports

    Output:
      - CITATION_AUDIT.md (human-readable per-entry verdict report)
      - CITATION_AUDIT.json (machine-readable verdict ledger)
      - Per-entry verdicts: KEEP / FIX / REPLACE / REMOVE

    If any REPLACE or REMOVE verdicts:
        Surface to user for human approval — never auto-modify content claims
    If only FIX verdicts (metadata corrections):
        Apply with user confirmation, then recompile
    If all KEEP:
        Pass — bibliography clean for submission
else:
    skip — no bib file or no citations
```

**Why this is the most diagnostic of the four audit layers:** wildly fake citations are easy to spot. The dangerous failure mode is a real paper used to support a claim it does not actually establish (wrong-context citations) — these slip past metadata-only checks and damage submission credibility. Run cost is wall-clock heavy (web lookup per entry); run once per submission, not per save.

**Empirical motivation:** in a real submission run, several real papers were cited in contexts they did not actually support, and at least one bib entry shipped with `author = "Anonymous"` because the metadata had not been resolved. None were caught by the improvement loop or numeric claim audit; only fresh web-lookup review surfaced them.

### Phase 5.9: Integrity Forensics (optional here — see Codex-native note)

The mainline pipeline defaults to a pre-submission Anti-Autoresearch sweep
(`/integrity-forensics` launcher: SHA-pinned clone, evidence ledger, nine
auditor dimensions, deterministic adjudication, typed BLOCK/WARN/NO_NEW_BLOCKER
gate + append-only obligations). **In a Codex-native session this is OFF by
default**: upstream ships no Codex-native pack, so only its deterministic-only
mode is runnable here (numeric core + adjudicator with an all-unavailable
coverage map — it can flag, it can never say CLEAN; translating upstream's
reviewer calls into `spawn_agent` would rewrite an upstream contract and is
forbidden). Run it with `— self_forensics: true` for the deterministic slice,
or run the full sweep from a Claude Code session. If it runs: gate `BLOCK`
refuses the Final Report; the gate records `same-family` proposal provenance
for a Codex executor — informational, since this gate only raises flags and
grants nothing. An opted-in run (`— self_forensics: true` in `$ARGUMENTS` —
re-check `$ARGUMENTS` at Phase 6.0, not conversation memory) that reaches the
Final Report without `paper/.aris/forensics/gate.json` is **incomplete, not
skippable**: run the slice before reporting.

### Phase 6: Final Report

**Phase 6.0 — Submission Gate**

Before writing the Final Report, resolve the active assurance level. This
uses the **same derivation rule as Phase 0** so a run where Phase 0 was
skipped or its write failed cannot silently downgrade a `beast` / `max` /
`— assurance: submission` invocation back to draft.

**Resolution at the gate** (re-derive; do not trust `.aris/assurance.txt`
alone):

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for an explicit `— assurance: draft | submission` or
   an `— effort: lite | balanced | max | beast` directive.
2. Derive the expected level:
   - explicit `assurance:` wins
   - else `lite` / `balanced` → `draft`, `max` / `beast` → `submission`
   - else `draft`
3. Read `paper/.aris/assurance.txt`. If the file is missing, write it now
   with the derived level.
4. If the file's value **disagrees** with the derived level (e.g. file
   says `draft` but `$ARGUMENTS` says `beast`), **overwrite** the file
   with the derived level and surface a one-line warning in-chat:
   `⚠️ .aris/assurance.txt was draft but $ARGUMENTS says submission; overriding.`
5. Use the re-derived level as authoritative for the rest of Phase 6.

```bash
# Final authoritative value, written and read from the same source
ASSURANCE=<derived-from-$ARGUMENTS>        # draft | submission
mkdir -p paper/.aris
echo "$ASSURANCE" > paper/.aris/assurance.txt
```

If `ASSURANCE=draft`, skip directly to the Final Report template below —
**current behavior, no change** for the default `balanced` user.

If `ASSURANCE=submission`, run the pre-flight checklist below, then the
verifier. The verifier's exit code is the source of truth — do NOT
self-declare "audits complete" based on conversation memory.

#### Submission pre-flight checklist

Print this checklist verbatim at the start of Phase 6.0 and confirm each row
before proceeding. This resists the common failure mode of the model
skipping audits while claiming to have run them.

```
📋 Submission audits required before Final Report:
   [ ] 0. PAPER_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md (Phase 1.5): re-read every assertion
          against the final PDF + results files; each → satisfied / violated /
          disputed-at-negotiation. ANY violated undisputed assertion blocks the
          Final Report until fixed or the human explicitly waives it (waivers
          recorded in the contract file). Contract absent (pre-1.5 run) → mark
          "no contract" and continue.
   [ ] 1. /proof-checker        → paper/PROOF_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 2. /paper-claim-audit    → paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 3. /citation-audit       → paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 4. Resolve $AUDIT_VERIFIER per integration-contract §2 (Policy A),
          then: bash "$AUDIT_VERIFIER" paper/ --assurance submission
   [ ] 5. Integrity forensics (Phase 5.9 — OPT-IN here): re-parse the CURRENT
          $ARGUMENTS. If it contains `— self_forensics: true`, require
          `python3 "$GATE_HELPER" fresh --paper-dir paper/ --anti-ar-commit
          "$ANTI_AR_COMMIT"` exit 0 (produced at the current pin; gate
          exists ∧ paper unchanged since ∧ ledger-bound ∧ decision
          pass-capable). Exit 1 → the deterministic slice never saw this
          text: run Phase 5.9 NOW. Not opted in → mark "n/a (opt-in)".
   [ ] 6. Block Final Report iff verifier exit code != 0 OR row 0 found a
          violated undisputed assertion OR row 5 is red. (THREE separate
          gates: row 0 is graded by instruction against the contract; the
          verifier checks audit JSONs only — verify_paper_audits.sh does NOT
          read the contract; row 5 reads the forensics gate artifact.)

#### Invoking the four audits

Each sub-audit runs in a **fresh Codex thread** (never a continuation reply,
never pass prior audit output as context — this preserves reviewer
independence per `shared-references/reviewer-independence.md`).

Each sub-audit **always** emits its JSON artifact, even when the content
detector is negative. A detector-negative run emits verdict
`NOT_APPLICABLE`; a silent skip is forbidden. See the "Submission artifact
emission" section of each audit's SKILL.md.

Order:

1. `/proof-checker "paper/"` → writes `paper/PROOF_AUDIT.json` (emits
   `NOT_APPLICABLE` if the paper contains no theorems / lemmas / proofs)
2. `/paper-claim-audit "paper/"` → writes `paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.json`
   (emits `NOT_APPLICABLE` if the paper has no numeric claims; emits
   `BLOCKED` if numeric claims exist but raw result files are missing)
3. `/citation-audit "paper/"` → writes `paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json`
   (emits `NOT_APPLICABLE` if no `.bib` file or no `\cite{...}` usage)

#### Running the verifier

Resolve `$AUDIT_VERIFIER` via the canonical strict-safe chain (see
[`shared-references/integration-contract.md`](../shared-references/integration-contract.md) §2,
Policy A — gate). Under `assurance: submission` the verifier is
load-bearing: if the helper is unresolved the SKILL aborts the Final
Report rather than producing an unverified `submission-ready` claim.

```bash
# Resolve the audit verifier (Policy A — gate; Codex-side chain).
if [ -z "${ARIS_REPO:-}" ] && [ -f .aris/installed-skills-codex.txt ]; then
    ARIS_REPO=$(awk -F'\t' '$1=="repo_root"{print $2; exit}' .aris/installed-skills-codex.txt 2>/dev/null) || true
fi
AUDIT_VERIFIER=""
[ -n "${ARIS_REPO:-}" ] && [ -f "$ARIS_REPO/tools/verify_paper_audits.sh" ] && AUDIT_VERIFIER="$ARIS_REPO/tools/verify_paper_audits.sh"
[ -z "$AUDIT_VERIFIER" ] && {
  echo "ERROR: verify_paper_audits.sh not resolved at \$ARIS_REPO/tools/." >&2
  echo "       assurance=submission requires the verifier; aborting Final Report." >&2
  exit 1
}

bash "$AUDIT_VERIFIER" paper/ --assurance submission
OVERALL_ASSURANCE=$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("paper/.aris/audit-verifier-report.json"))["overall_assurance"])')
```

- **Exit 0** — All mandatory audits present, JSON schema-valid, hashes fresh,
  no blocking verdicts. Proceed to the Final Report below. If
  `OVERALL_ASSURANCE=provisional`, the report MUST say
  `Submission-ready: provisional`; only `accepted` may say `yes`.
- **Exit 1** — Surface `paper/.aris/audit-verifier-report.json` to the user
  verbatim, **refuse to generate the Final Report**, and list the specific
  remediation for each failing row:
  - `MISSING` → rerun that audit
  - `STALE` → paper files edited after the audit ran; rerun the affected audit
  - `BLOCKING_VERDICT` (FAIL / BLOCKED / ERROR) → fix the underlying issue,
    then rerun the audit
  - `SCHEMA_INVALID` → audit artifact malformed; rerun the audit

The verifier is cheap to rerun (< 1 s). After fixing any issue, rerun it
before claiming green.

#### Optional hardening (not default)

Teams that want hook-level enforcement — i.e., the harness physically
prevents a Stop event while the verifier is red — can register an equivalent
Codex stop hook if their local Codex runtime supports hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {"command": "bash <ARIS_REPO>/tools/verify_paper_audits.sh paper/ --assurance submission"}
    ]
  }
}
```

This is documented here, not required. Phase 6.0's verifier-as-truth
pattern is the default repo behavior.

**Phase 6.1 — Final Report** (runs only after the submission gate is green,
or directly if `assurance=draft`)

# Paper Writing Pipeline Report

**Input**: [NARRATIVE_REPORT.md or topic]
**Venue**: [ICLR/NeurIPS/ICML/CVPR/ACL/AAAI/ACM/IEEE_JOURNAL/IEEE_CONF]
**Assurance**: [draft | submission]
**Submission-ready**: [yes | provisional | no]   <!-- yes iff overall_assurance=accepted; provisional iff same-family review passed -->
**Forensics**: [NO_NEW_BLOCKER | WARN: <n> open obligations | BLOCK | n/a (opt-in, not requested)]   <!-- deterministic slice only; from .aris/forensics/gate.json — a WARN's open obligations MUST be listed in this report, never silently passed -->
**Date**: [today]

## Pipeline Summary

| Phase | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0. Assurance Setup | ✅ | paper/.aris/assurance.txt = [draft\|submission] |
| 1. Paper Plan | ✅ | PAPER_PLAN.md |
| 1.5 Acceptance Contract | [accepted\|contested\|no contract] ([N] rounds) | PAPER_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md |
| 2. Figures | ✅ | figures/ ([N] auto + [M] manual) |
| 3. LaTeX Writing | ✅ | paper/sections/*.tex ([N] sections, [M] citations) |
| 4. Compilation | ✅ | paper/main.pdf ([X] pages) |
| 5. Improvement | ✅ | [score0]/10 → [score2]/10 |
| 4.5 Proof Audit | [PASS\|WARN\|FAIL\|NOT_APPLICABLE\|BLOCKED\|ERROR] | PROOF_AUDIT.{md,json} |
| 5.5 Paper Claim Audit | [PASS\|WARN\|FAIL\|NOT_APPLICABLE\|BLOCKED\|ERROR] | PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.{md,json} |
| 5.8 Citation Audit | [PASS\|WARN\|FAIL\|NOT_APPLICABLE\|BLOCKED\|ERROR] | CITATION_AUDIT.{md,json} |
| 6.0 Assurance Verifier | [accepted\|provisional\|blocked]; exit [0\|1] overall (N/A if draft) | .aris/audit-verifier-report.json |

## Improvement Scores
| Round | Score | Key Changes |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Round 0 | X/10 | Baseline |
| Round 1 | Y/10 | [summary] |
| Round 2 | Z/10 | [summary] |

## Deliverables
- paper/main.pdf — Final polished paper
- paper/main_round0_original.pdf — Before improvement
- paper/main_round1.pdf — After round 1
- paper/main_round2.pdf — After round 2
- paper/PAPER_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md — Full review log
- paper/PROOF_AUDIT.{md,json} — Proof-obligation verification (always emitted at `assurance=submission`; `NOT_APPLICABLE` when no theorems)
- paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.{md,json} — Numerical claim verification (always emitted at `assurance=submission`; `NOT_APPLICABLE` when no numeric claims; omitted in `draft` mode if Phase 5.5 detector was negative)
- paper/CITATION_AUDIT.{md,json} — Bibliography verification (always emitted at `assurance=submission`; `NOT_APPLICABLE` when no `.bib` or no `\cite{...}`; omitted in `draft` mode if Phase 5.8 detector was negative)
- paper/.aris/audit-verifier-report.json — External verifier report (submission only)

## Remaining Issues (if any)
- [items from final review that weren't addressed]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Visual inspection of PDF
- [ ] Add any missing manual figures
- [ ] Submit to [venue] via OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP
```

## Output Protocols

> Follow these shared protocols for all output files:
> - **[Output Versioning Protocol](../shared-references/output-versioning.md)** — write timestamped file first, then copy to fixed name
> - **[Output Manifest Protocol](../shared-references/output-manifest.md)** — log every output to MANIFEST.md
> - **[Output Language Protocol](../shared-references/output-language.md)** — note: paper-writing always outputs English LaTeX for venue submission

## Key Rules

- **Large file handling**: If the Write tool fails due to file size, immediately retry using Bash (`cat << 'EOF' > file`) to write in chunks. Do NOT ask the user for permission — just do it silently.
- **Don't skip phases.** Each phase builds on the previous one — skipping leads to errors.
- **Checkpoint between phases** when AUTO_PROCEED=false. Present results and wait for approval.
- **Manual figures first.** If the paper needs architecture diagrams or qualitative results, the user must provide them before Phase 3.
- **Compilation must succeed** before entering the improvement loop. Fix all errors first.
- **Preserve all PDFs.** The user needs round0/round1/round2 for comparison.
- **Document everything.** The pipeline report should be self-contained.
- **Respect page limits.** If the paper exceeds the venue limit, suggest specific cuts before the improvement loop.

## Composing with Other Workflows

```
/idea-discovery "direction"         ← Workflow 1: find ideas
implement                           ← write code
/run-experiment                     ← deploy experiments
/auto-review-loop "paper topic"     ← Workflow 2: iterate research
/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md"  ← Workflow 3: you are here
                                         submit! 🎉

Or use /research-pipeline for the Workflow 1+2 end-to-end flow,
then /paper-writing for the final writing step.
```

## Typical Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Can sleep? |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1. Paper Plan | 5-10 min | No |
| 2. Figures | 5-15 min | No |
| 3. LaTeX Writing | 15-30 min | Yes ✅ |
| 4. Compilation | 2-5 min | No |
| 5. Improvement | 15-30 min | Yes ✅ |

**Total: ~45-90 min** for a full paper from narrative report to polished PDF.
