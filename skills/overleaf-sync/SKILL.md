# Overleaf Sync

Bridge a local paper directory with an Overleaf project so that:

- **You** can keep editing in the Overleaf web UI (or share editing access with collaborators)
- **ARIS** can read your changes, run audits (`/paper-claim-audit`, `/citation-audit`, `/auto-paper-improvement-loop`), and push fixes back

This uses the official **Overleaf Git bridge** (Premium feature). The agent **never sees your authentication token** — you do the one-time auth manually so the token lives in macOS Keychain, not in chat history or `.git/config`.

## When to Use This Skill

- You want to use Overleaf as the editing surface (better collaboration, shared with team) but still run ARIS pipelines locally
- You want to take an existing local ARIS paper and push it to Overleaf for a co-author to edit
- A collaborator made changes in Overleaf and you want to pull + diff them before continuing local work

## Constants

- **CLONE_DIR_DEFAULT** = `paper-overleaf` (sibling of existing `paper/`, NOT inside `paper/`)
- **CREDENTIAL_HELPER** = `osxkeychain` (macOS) / `manager` (Windows) / `cache` (Linux fallback)
- **TOKEN_HANDLING** = **NEVER write token to disk, env var, or chat**. User pastes it once into the terminal credential prompt; the OS keychain stores it from then on.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐       git pull/push      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Local paper/   │ ◄─── rsync ──── ►       │ paper-overleaf/ │ ◄──► Overleaf web
│  (ARIS audits)  │                          │ (git bridge)    │     (collaborators)
└─────────────────┘                          └─────────────────┘
```

The `paper-overleaf/` directory is a **git clone of the Overleaf project**. The `paper/` directory is the working copy where ARIS skills run. They are kept in sync via `rsync`.

**Single-source-of-truth rule**: at any given time, treat *one* of them as authoritative for active editing. Switch directions explicitly with `pull` or `push`, and run a `status` check before either to surface unexpected divergence.

## Sub-commands

### `setup <project-id>` — one-time

Sets up the bridge for a new Overleaf project. **The user runs this in their own terminal, never through the agent.** The skill ships with a hardened setup script that:

1. Refuses to run unless stdin/stdout are a TTY (won't run inside an agent harness)
2. Reads the token from a hidden prompt (no chat history, no shell history)
3. Strips the token from the remote URL immediately after cloning
4. Primes the OS keychain so subsequent agent operations are auth-free
5. **Auto-installs a `pre-commit` hook in `paper-overleaf/.git/hooks/` that refuses to commit any blob containing the token pattern `olp_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`** — a hard technical block, not a behavioral rule

The agent's only role here is to print the user instruction:

```
Run this in your own terminal (NOT through me):

    bash <ARIS_REPO>/tools/overleaf_setup.sh <project-id-or-url>

When it finishes, tell me "setup done" and I'll verify.
```

After the user reports "setup done", the agent verifies (token-free):

```bash
cd paper-overleaf
git remote -v                    # must show URL WITHOUT token
git config --get credential.helper
git fetch && git log --oneline -3   # must succeed without prompting
ls .git/hooks/pre-commit         # must exist
bash <ARIS_REPO>/tools/overleaf_audit.sh .   # must report "Audit clean"
```

If `paper-overleaf/` exists but is empty (new Overleaf project), the agent then mirrors local `paper/` into it (see `push` workflow).

### `pull` — before each editing session

```bash
cd paper-overleaf && git pull --ff-only

# Show what changed since last pull
LAST=$(git rev-parse HEAD@{1})
git diff --stat $LAST..HEAD
git diff $LAST..HEAD -- 'sec/*.tex'        # detailed view for prose changes
```

**Diff protocol — DO NOT blindly merge into local `paper/`.** Overleaf edits frequently include:

- **Half-finished sentences** (collaborator clicked save mid-thought)
- **Typos** that aren't in canonical references (`Lrage` for `Large`)
- **Commented-out blocks** that may be intentional or may be a stash
- **Number changes** that should re-trigger `/paper-claim-audit`
- **Cite key changes** that should re-trigger `/citation-audit`

For each diff hunk, decide one of:

| Hunk character | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Clean editorial improvement | Sync into `paper/`, no audit needed |
| Numerical / claim change | Sync, then re-run `/paper-claim-audit` |
| New `\cite{...}` | Sync, then re-run `/citation-audit` |
| Half-sentence / obvious typo | Flag to user, do NOT auto-sync |
| New section / restructure | Stop, ask user before syncing |

After deciding per-hunk:

```bash
# Sync only the files the user approved into local paper/
rsync -av paper-overleaf/sec/0.abstract.tex paper/sec/0.abstract.tex
# (or use Edit tool for surgical changes that skip half-sentences)
```

### `push` — after local editing

Use after ARIS skills have edited `paper/` and you want collaborators on Overleaf to see the changes.

```bash
# 1. Always pull first to surface remote drift
cd paper-overleaf && git pull --ff-only

# 2. If pull was a no-op, sync local paper → paper-overleaf
rsync -av --delete \
  --exclude='.git' --exclude='.DS_Store' \
  --exclude='*.aux' --exclude='*.log' --exclude='*.bbl' --exclude='*.blg' \
  --exclude='*.fls' --exclude='*.fdb_latexmk' --exclude='*.out' \
  --exclude='*.synctex.gz' --exclude='*.toc' \
  paper/ paper-overleaf/

# 3. Show what would be pushed
git status --short
git diff --stat

# 4. Commit + push
git add -A
git commit -m "<descriptive message — what ARIS changed and why>"
git push
```

**Commit message protocol**: include the ARIS skill that produced the change so collaborators on Overleaf understand provenance. Examples:

- `paper-write: regenerated sec/3.assurance after audit cascade refactor`
- `citation-audit: fix 14 metadata entries (madaan2023, lee2024, ...)`
- `paper-claim-audit: correct sec/5 numbers vs results/run_2026_04_19.json`

**Confirmation gate**: `push` writes to a shared resource. ALWAYS show the user `git diff --stat` (and a representative hunk for prose changes) before running `git push`. Wait for explicit confirmation unless the user said `auto: true` upfront.

### `status` — diagnostic

```bash
cd paper-overleaf
git fetch
echo "=== Remote-vs-local divergence ==="
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/master    # remote ahead
git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD    # local ahead
echo "=== paper/ vs paper-overleaf/ divergence ==="
diff -rq --brief paper/ paper-overleaf/ 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -v "Only in paper/.*\.\(aux\|log\|out\|fls\|fdb_latexmk\|bbl\|blg\|synctex\|toc\)" \
  | grep -v "Only in paper-overleaf/.git" \
  | grep -v "DS_Store"
```

Three-way state assessment:

| Remote ahead? | paper/ vs paper-overleaf/ differ? | Meaning | Recommended action |
|:-------------:|:---------------------------------:|---------|--------------------|
| No  | No  | Clean       | Nothing to do |
| Yes | No  | Overleaf has new edits | Run `pull`, then re-run status |
| No  | Yes | Local ARIS edits unsynced | Run `push` |
| Yes | Yes | Diverged — needs merge | Stop, surface to user, do NOT auto-resolve |

## Conflict Resolution

If `git pull --ff-only` fails because of true divergence:

1. **Do not** run `git pull` (which would auto-merge).
2. **Do not** run `git reset --hard` or `git push --force` (destructive).
3. Show the user `git log origin/master ^HEAD` (their Overleaf commits) and `git log HEAD ^origin/master` (local ARIS commits).
4. Ask the user which side to take per file, or to manually merge in Overleaf and then re-pull.

## Token Security — Defense in Depth

Behavioral rules alone are not enough — the next agent reading this skill might forget them. The skill therefore relies on **technical guards** that hold even if the agent misbehaves:

| Layer | Guard | Where enforced |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1. Setup | `overleaf_setup.sh` refuses to run without an interactive TTY (agents don't have one) | `tools/overleaf_setup.sh` |
| 2. Input | Token is read by `read -s` (hidden prompt, no shell history, never enters chat) | `tools/overleaf_setup.sh` |
| 3. Storage | Token goes straight into OS keychain via `git credential approve`; remote URL is stripped to a token-free form | `tools/overleaf_setup.sh` |
| 4. Commits | `paper-overleaf/.git/hooks/pre-commit` greps staged content for `olp_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` and aborts | auto-installed by setup script |
| 5. Audit | `overleaf_audit.sh` scans working tree, remote URLs, git history, credential files | `tools/overleaf_audit.sh` |

Behavioral rules (still apply, but secondary):

- **Never** ask the user to paste a token into chat. If they do anyway: (a) acknowledge it, (b) tell them to revoke it at https://www.overleaf.com/user/settings, (c) recover via keychain if already primed.
- **Never** write a token to a file (`.env`, `.netrc`, `tools/*.sh`, etc.) committed to any repo.
- **Never** include a token in a `git remote -v` URL — strip it after clone.
- On `401 Unauthorized` from push/pull, tell the user the keychain entry expired and to re-run `overleaf_setup.sh`. Do **not** ask for a fresh token.

## Mutual-Exclusion Rule

The single biggest source of pain in two-way sync is **simultaneous editing on both sides**.

- If the user is in an active Overleaf editing session, ARIS skills should **read-only** access `paper/` until the user runs `/overleaf-sync pull`.
- If ARIS is in the middle of `/auto-paper-improvement-loop` or `/paper-write`, the user should pause Overleaf editing until the loop finishes and `/overleaf-sync push` is run.

When in doubt, run `status` first.

## Output Contract

- `paper-overleaf/` directory at repo root, git clone of Overleaf project (origin URL has NO token)
- `paper/` directory unchanged in role — still the ARIS working copy
- Each `pull`/`push` operation: a one-line summary back to the user (commits pulled / pushed, file count, link to Overleaf project URL)
