## §0 TL;DR Cheat Sheet

> 💡 **Attention in 7 sentences** — one-page interview essentials (full derivations in §2-§9).

1. **Formula**: $\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\dfrac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V$.

2. **Why divide by √d_k**: if $q_i, k_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ are independent, then $\text{Var}(q\cdot k) = d_k$; dividing by $\sqrt{d_k}$ pulls variance back to 1 and avoids softmax saturation.

3. **Multi-Head**: split $D$ into $H$ heads, each doing independent attention in its own subspace, then concat and project with $W_o$. **For fixed $D$ with $d_k=D/H$, standard MHA parameter count is $\approx 4D^2$ (independent of $H$); MQA/GQA shrinks the K/V projections.**

4. **Self vs Cross**: in self-attention Q/K/V share the same source; in cross-attention Q comes from the query stream while K/V come from the context stream (encoder output / image tokens / text embedding).

5. **Causal mask vs Padding mask**: the former uses a lower triangle to block the future; the latter uses `[B,1,1,L_k]` to mask out padding columns.

6. **Complexity**: $O(B H L^2 d_k)$ time and $O(B H L^2)$ score memory — long sequences are bottlenecked by the quadratic term.

7. **Common footguns**: fully-masked row → softmax NaN; FP16 $QK^\top$ can overflow; attention weight ≠ causal explanation.

## §1 Attention Intuition

The essence of attention is **learned retrieval**:

- Each **query** ("what information do I need right now?")

- Computes similarity against all **keys** ("what does each position claim to offer?")

- Softmax-normalizes into a **weight distribution**

- Takes a weighted sum of all **values** ("what each position actually contributes")

Contrast with RNNs: an RNN **compresses past information into a fixed-size hidden state**, so long sequences inevitably lose information; attention **directly, globally, and dynamically** retrieves all past positions at every step, which is why it suits long-range dependencies.

"Q/K/V come from the same vector passed through three different projections" — proactively say this in interviews, since newcomers often mistakenly think Q/K/V are three separate inputs.

## §2 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

### 2.1　Formula

$$\boxed{\;\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V\;}$$

Shapes:

- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{L_q \times d_k}$, $K \in \mathbb{R}^{L_k \times d_k}$, $V \in \mathbb{R}^{L_k \times d_v}$

- Scores $QK^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{L_q \times L_k}$ (similarity of each query to all keys)

- Softmax over the **key dimension**: weights per query row sum to 1

- Output $\in \mathbb{R}^{L_q \times d_v}$

### 2.2　Why divide by √d_k (mandatory: know the variance derivation)

Assume $q, k \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k}$ have i.i.d. components with $q_i, k_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Consider the dot product:

$$q \cdot k = \sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_i k_i$$

By independence, each term $q_i k_i$ has mean $= \mathbb{E}[q_i]\mathbb{E}[k_i] = 0$ and variance $= \mathbb{E}[q_i^2]\mathbb{E}[k_i^2] = 1$. So:

$$\mathbb{E}[q\cdot k] = 0, \quad \text{Var}[q\cdot k] = d_k$$

When $d_k$ is large (e.g., 64, 128), the typical magnitude of $q\cdot k$ is $\sqrt{d_k}$. After softmax, **the largest logit easily grabs nearly all the probability mass**, softmax enters its saturation regime, gradients shrink dramatically, and training slows or stalls. Dividing by $\sqrt{d_k}$ pulls variance back to 1, **alleviating saturation and improving gradient scale**.

> ⚠️ **Bonus interview point: FP16 overflow** — even after dividing by √d_k, the `QK^T` accumulation itself can overflow in FP16 (fp16 max ≈ 65504). Production implementations use fused SDPA / FlashAttention or **fp32 accumulation** to solve this. `torch.softmax` internally does log-sum-exp stabilization (subtract max logit before exp), but that happens inside the softmax step and cannot prevent matmul accumulation overflow.

### 2.3　Mask and the NaN pitfall (💣 classic bug, mandatory interview topic)

Standard practice: fill positions to be masked with $-\infty$ in the scores; after softmax their probability is 0.

But there's a pitfall: **if every key in a row is masked** (e.g., query 0 in cross-attn where context is all padding; causal + left padding; a query with no legal token after it), that row's scores are all $-\infty$, and softmax outputs:

$$\text{softmax}([-\infty, -\infty, ..., -\infty]) = \text{NaN}$$

because both numerator and denominator are $e^{-\infty} = 0$, $0/0 = $ NaN, which then contaminates the entire batch's gradient.

> ✅ **Fix: detect fully-masked rows → zero them after softmax** —

```python
# Detect fully-masked rows
all_masked = (~mask).all(dim=-1, keepdim=True)   # [..., L_q, 1]
# Temporarily unmask the row (to avoid NaN)
safe_mask = mask | all_masked
scores = scores.masked_fill(~safe_mask, float("-inf"))

# Softmax computes normally
weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

# Force the fully-masked row's output to 0 (otherwise it yields a uniform distribution)
weights = weights.masked_fill(all_masked, 0.0)
```

> ⚠️ **Mask semantics are inconsistent (proactively disambiguate)** — this implementation / `F.scaled_dot_product_attention`: **True = keep**

`nn.MultiheadAttention`'s `attn_mask` / `key_padding_mask`: **True = mask out** (opposite!)

Before writing code in an interview, ask the interviewer for the convention, or proactively state your convention, otherwise it's easy to get this backward.

### 2.4　Code (core 20 lines)

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None, dropout_p=0.0, training=True):
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = Q @ K.transpose(-2, -1)                 # [..., L_q, L_k]
    scores = scores / math.sqrt(d_k)                 # ← key scale

    if mask is not None:
        all_masked = (~mask).all(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
        safe_mask = mask | all_masked
        scores = scores.masked_fill(~safe_mask, float("-inf"))
    else:
        all_masked = None

    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

    if all_masked is not None:
        weights = weights.masked_fill(all_masked, 0.0)   # NaN guard

    if dropout_p > 0.0 and training:
        weights = F.dropout(weights, p=dropout_p)

    return weights @ V, weights                       # output, weights
```

## §3 Multi-Head Attention

### 3.1　Formula

$$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_H) W_o$$

$$\text{head}_h = \text{Attention}(Q W_q^{(h)},\; K W_k^{(h)},\; V W_v^{(h)})$$

Each head has $W_q^{(h)}, W_k^{(h)}, W_v^{(h)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times d_k}$ with $d_k = D/H$. **In practice we concat the H per-head projection matrices into one $D \times D$ matrix** and run all heads' projections in a single matmul (GPU-friendly):

```

Input X [B, L, D]
   │
   │  W_q, W_k, W_v ∈ R^{D×D}   (each = concat of H matrices W^{(h)} ∈ R^{D×d_k})
   ↓
Q, K, V [B, L, D]
   │
   │  reshape [B, L, D] → [B, L, H, d_k] → transpose → [B, H, L, d_k]
   ↓
Scaled-Dot-Product Attention independently per head (batched matmul, parallel)
   ↓
heads [B, H, L_q, d_k]
   │
   │  transpose + reshape → [B, L_q, D]   (concat heads)
   ↓
W_o ∈ R^{D×D}    →    Output [B, L_q, D]
```

### 3.2　Why multi-head (would a single head work?)

- **Different subspaces**: each head learns one relational pattern in its own $d_k$-dim subspace (syntax, coreference, long-distance dependency, local n-gram, ...)

- **Expressiveness**: a single head learns only one attention pattern; H heads give H different weighted-sum outputs **in parallel** at inference

- **Parameter efficiency**: $d_k = D/H$ rather than $D$, so parameter count doesn't grow linearly with H

- Common interview question: are more heads always better? **No.** $d_k = D/H$ being too small (e.g., $d_k < 16$) limits each head's expressiveness; Mistral / LLaMA use head_dim ≈ 64-128 as the sweet spot

### 3.3　Parameter count and FLOPs

| Component | Shape | Parameter count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $W_q$ | $D \times D$ | $D^2$ |
| $W_k$ | $D \times D$ | $D^2$ |
| $W_v$ | $D \times D$ | $D^2$ |
| $W_o$ | $D \times D$ | $D^2$ |
| **Total** |  | **$4D^2$** (independent of $H$) |

FLOPs (single self-attention forward, $L_q = L_k = L$):

- QKV projection: $3 \cdot 2 B L D^2 = 6 B L D^2$

- $QK^\top$: $2 B H L^2 d_k = 2 B L^2 D$

- Softmax weight × V: $2 B L^2 D$

- Output projection $W_o$: $2 B L D^2$

- **Total $\approx 8 B L D^2 + 4 B L^2 D$** — the first term is linear in $L$, the second quadratic (long-sequence bottleneck)

### 3.4　Code (core 30 lines)

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, dropout=0.0, bias=False):
        super().__init__()
        assert d_model % num_heads == 0
        self.d_model, self.num_heads, self.d_k = d_model, num_heads, d_model // num_heads

        # Merge H per-head W^(h) into one [D, D] matrix
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=bias)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=bias)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=bias)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=bias)
        self.dropout_p = dropout

    def _split(self, x):  # [B, L, D] → [B, H, L, d_k]
        B, L, _ = x.shape
        return x.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)

    def _merge(self, x):  # [B, H, L, d_k] → [B, L, D]
        B, _, L, _ = x.shape
        return x.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, L, self.d_model)

    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        Q = self._split(self.W_q(query))
        K = self._split(self.W_k(key))
        V = self._split(self.W_v(value))

        if mask is not None:
            if mask.dim() == 2: mask = mask.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)   # [1,1,L_q,L_k]
            elif mask.dim() == 3: mask = mask.unsqueeze(1)              # [B,1,L_q,L_k]
            # dim=4: already aligned

        out, w = scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=mask, dropout_p=self.dropout_p, training=self.training)
        return self.W_o(self._merge(out)), w
```

## §4 Self / Cross / Causal / Padding

### 4.1　Self vs Cross Attention (mandatory)

|  | Self-Attention | Cross-Attention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Q source** | $X$ | $X_\text{decoder}$ / latent / learnable queries |
| **K, V source** | $X$ (same) | $X_\text{encoder}$ / context / memory |
| **$L_q$ vs $L_k$** | equal | can differ |
| **Typical mask** | causal (decoder) or padding (encoder) | K/V-side padding mask (no causal) |
| **Purpose** | intra-position correlation | retrieve relevant info from external memory |
| **Examples** | every BERT layer; every GPT layer; ViT | Transformer Decoder's second sub-layer; DETR; Perceiver; Stable Diffusion (image Q × text K/V) |

### 4.2　Causal Mask (Decoder / GPT)

Lower-triangular matrix (including diagonal): row $i$ may attend to keys $j \le i$.

```python
def causal_mask(L, device=None):
    return torch.tril(torch.ones(L, L, dtype=torch.bool, device=device))
# L=4 →
# [[T F F F]
#  [T T F F]
#  [T T T F]
#  [T T T T]]
```

### 4.3　Padding Mask (variable-length sequences)

Each sample has a different valid length; padding tokens must not be attended:

```python
def padding_mask(lengths, max_len=None):
    if max_len is None: max_len = int(lengths.max())
    idx = torch.arange(max_len, device=lengths.device).unsqueeze(0).expand(len(lengths), -1)
    return idx < lengths.unsqueeze(1)    # [B, L]    True=valid, False=padding

# Usage: must unsqueeze to [B, 1, 1, L_k] so it broadcasts to [B, H, L_q, L_k] inside MHA
pmask = padding_mask(lengths).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(1)   # [B, 1, 1, L_k]
out, _ = mha(x, x, x, mask=pmask)
```

> 💡 **Causal + padding together** — AND the two masks: `combined = causal_mask & padding_mask_4d`. Mind the broadcast dims: causal is `[L,L]`, padding is `[B,1,1,L_k]`, and the AND yields `[B,1,L,L]`.

## §5 Complexity Analysis

|  | Time | Memory | Bottleneck |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RNN | $O(L \cdot D^2)$ | $O(D)$ | sequential, not parallelizable |
| Self-Attention | $O(L^2 \cdot D)$ | $O(L^2 + L \cdot D)$ | $L^2$ score matrix (long sequences) |
| Conv (kernel $k$) | $O(L \cdot k \cdot D^2)$ | $O(D)$ | limited receptive field |

Key points:

- Self-attention's $L^2$ **compute** is acceptable (GPU parallel), but **$L^2$ memory** (score matrix) is the real bottleneck — this is the pain point Flash Attention attacks

- At LLM inference, the prefill stage is $O(L^2)$; the decode stage with KV cache is $O(L)$ per step (see §6)

- When $L \approx D$, attention and FFN take similar time; when $L \gg D$, attention dominates

## §6 KV Cache + MQA / GQA

### 6.1　KV Cache (key optimization for autoregressive inference)

Problem: when GPT generates autoregressively, every new token re-runs the entire prefix through the forward pass — across $t$ steps that's $O(t^2)$ redundant computation.

Solution: cache each layer's $K^{(\ell)}, V^{(\ell)}$. When generating the $(t+1)$-th token:

- Compute only the new token's $q_{t+1}, k_{t+1}, v_{t+1}$ (size $1 \times D$)

- Append $k_{t+1}, v_{t+1}$ to the cache

- The new $q$ attends over the full cache ($O(t)$, not $O(t^2)$)

> ⚠️ **Footgun** — KV cache is an **inference optimization**; it **cannot** be used in training — at training time all positions do attention simultaneously, there is no "token-by-token generation".

**KV cache memory (per sample)**:

$$\text{KV cache} = L_\text{ctx} \cdot n_\text{layers} \cdot \underbrace{2}_{K, V} \cdot H_\text{kv} \cdot d_\text{head} \cdot \text{bytes\_per\_elem}$$

Note: under MQA/GQA $H_\text{kv} \ll H$, shrinking the cache dramatically. For LLaMA-2-70B (GQA, $H_\text{kv}=8$), $L_\text{ctx}=4096$, 80 layers, fp16: about **1.25 GB / sample** — this is why LLaMA-2 uses GQA instead of MHA (vanilla MHA would reach 10 GB / sample).

### 6.2　MQA / GQA (attacking KV-cache memory)

| Variant | Q heads | K/V heads | KV cache reduction | Used in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MHA** (vanilla) | $H$ | $H$ | 1× | original Transformer |
| **MQA** (Multi-Query) | $H$ | **1** | $H \times$ | PaLM, Falcon |
| **GQA** (Grouped-Query) | $H$ | $G$ ($1 < G < H$) | $H/G \times$ | LLaMA-2/3, Mistral |

Core idea: **multiple Q heads share one set of K/V**. MQA is extreme but slightly hurts quality; GQA is a compromise (e.g., H=32, G=8) that cuts memory/bandwidth by 4× with essentially no quality loss.

> ❌ **Footgun** — MQA/GQA reduce **KV-cache memory + memory bandwidth**, **not** Q-projection compute (Q head count is unchanged). Interviewers love to push back with "what exactly did it reduce?".

## §7 FlashAttention Core Tricks

Problem: standard attention has to materialize the $L \times L$ score matrix, and HBM read/write IO is the bottleneck (not FLOPs).

FlashAttention idea (**IO-aware exact attention**, not an approximation):

1. **Block tiling**: split $Q, K, V$ into blocks and load only one $Q$ block plus one $K, V$ block into SRAM at a time

2. **Online softmax**: maintain a running max $m$ and running sum $\ell$ incrementally, avoiding ever materializing the full score matrix

3. **Recompute on backward**: recompute attention during the backward pass instead of storing $L^2$ scores

Effects:

- **Avoids materializing** the full $L \times L$ scores / probs matrix in HBM

- The paper's HBM IO complexity is about $O(L^2 d^2 / M + Ld)$, vs $O(L^2 + Ld)$ HBM traffic for standard attention — when $L$ is large and $M$ (SRAM) is appropriate, IO drops sharply

- Peak memory drops from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ (no stored intermediate scores)

- Typical speedup 2-4× (depends on sequence length & GPU architecture)

- **Mathematically equivalent** (exact attention, not sparse / linear approximation)

> 💡 **FlashAttention v1/v2/v3 key differences** — v1 (2022): online softmax + block tiling + recompute. v2 (2023): swap the inner/outer loops (Q-outer, KV-inner) + better warp-level parallelism + fewer non-matmul FLOPs. v3 (2024): targets H100 Hopper with WGMMA / TMA / FP8 + asynchronous pipeline. Interviews usually focus on v1/v2 and online-softmax details.

## §8 Position Encoding (RoPE / ALiBi / Absolute)

| Method | Principle | Extrapolation | Used in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sinusoidal absolute** | Fixed sin/cos position vector added to the input embedding | Position encoding itself can be defined for any length, but the model may not generalize past trained lengths | Original Transformer (Vaswani 2017) |
| **Learned absolute** | Treat position as a token and learn an embedding table | Poor (the table is fixed-size, a hard limit) | BERT, GPT-2 |
| **RoPE** (Rotary) | Apply position-dependent rotation to $Q, K$: $q_m \to q_m e^{im\theta}$ (complex-number view) — **the position-dependent term enters via relative shift $m-n$ in the inner product** (content vectors still influence scores) | Medium (naturally captures relative position; out-of-length needs NTK-aware / YaRN) | LLaMA-1/2/3, Mistral, Qwen |
| **ALiBi** | Add a positional-distance bias to scores: $\text{score}_{ij} - m \cdot \lvert i-j \rvert$ | Good (linear bias extrapolates naturally) | BLOOM, MPT |

### 8.1　Attention Sink (advanced topic)

In trained LLMs, attention at decode time concentrates abnormally on the first 1-4 tokens (especially [BOS] / the first token), even when those tokens are content-irrelevant. This phenomenon is called **attention sink**. **A common intuitive explanation**: softmax forces weights to sum to 1, so when a query doesn't really want to attend to anything, it needs a "junk slot" to absorb probability mass; and because early tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, training naturally produces a global sink. StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., ICLR 2024) exploits this for long-sequence inference (keep the attention sink + a sliding window).

## §9 Attention in Diffusion (mandatory if you mention generative work)

For candidates with a diffusion background, interviewers almost always ask about attention in generative models.

### 9.1　Cross-Attention in Latent Diffusion (Stable Diffusion)

```

Image latent (z_t)  [B, C, H, W]
   │
   │  flatten to tokens [B, HW, D]
   ↓
Self-Attention (Q=K=V from image)
   ↓
Cross-Attention:
    Q = image tokens [B, HW, D]
    K, V = text embedding [B, L_text, D]    ← text conditioning
   ↓
FFN → next layer
```

Key points:

- Text-to-image conditioning is realized via cross-attention: image tokens are queries, text embeddings are keys/values

- Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG): two forwards (with text / without text), then take the difference. For $\epsilon$-pred: $\epsilon_\text{CFG} = \epsilon_\text{uncond} + s (\epsilon_\text{cond} - \epsilon_\text{uncond})$; for v-pred / x0-pred swap in the corresponding prediction — the linear guidance form is analogous

- SD / SDXL U-Nets alternate self-attn and cross-attn inside Transformer blocks at multiple spatial resolutions

- DiT (Diffusion Transformer) replaces the U-Net with a pure Transformer; conditioning enters via AdaLN / cross-attn / token-concat

### 9.2　Attention in video diffusion

- **Spatial attention**: within each frame (between image patches)

- **Temporal attention**: across frames (between the same position at different time steps)

- **Spatiotemporal / full attention**: all frames × all positions — most expensive, infeasible for long video

- Long-video attention is an open problem ($L \sim 10^4$-$10^5$ tokens); common routes: factorization (spatial + temporal alternated), sparse window, hierarchical pooling, chunked attention

Compiled from the perspective of a top-lab interviewer by codex (gpt-5.5 xhigh), in 3 difficulty tiers. Click each question to see the key answer points + common pitfalls.

### L1 must-know (any ML engineering role will ask)

<details>

<summary>Q1. What is the attention formula?</summary>

- $\text{softmax}(QK^\top / \sqrt{d_k}) V$

- Softmax over the keys dimension

- Output is a weighted sum of values

Writing the softmax dim on the query axis.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q2. Why divide by √d_k?</summary>

- If $q_i, k_i$ are independent zero-mean unit-variance

- The dot-product variance is about $d_k$

- After scaling, variance returns to 1, avoiding softmax saturation

Just saying "to prevent values from being too large" without giving the variance derivation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q3. What do Q/K/V represent?</summary>

- Q is the retrieval query

- K is the matching index

- V is the content to aggregate

Saying Q/K/V are three different inputs; in self-attn they share a source but use different projections.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q4. Why is multi-head useful?</summary>

- Different subspaces model different relations

- Multiple positional / semantic patterns in parallel

- Concat then fuse

Saying "more heads is always better". In reality if $d_k$ is too small, expressiveness suffers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q5. How does MHA's parameter count scale with the number of heads?</summary>

- Fixed $D$ with $d_k = D/H$ (standard MHA)

- $W_q + W_k + W_v + W_o$ sums to $4D^2$, **independent of $H$**

- But under MQA/GQA, the K/V projection matrix shrinks ($H_\text{kv} < H$ heads)

- This is why "head count is free" holds for standard MHA but pays off in memory under MQA/GQA

Thinking parameter count grows linearly with H; or forgetting that MQA/GQA changes the K/V projection dimensions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q6. Self-attention vs cross-attention?</summary>

- Self: Q/K/V share a source

- Cross: Q comes from the target, K/V from the context

- Cross is common in encoder-decoder, diffusion text conditioning

Saying "cross has two inputs" without explaining the Q vs KV sourcing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q7. How do you write a causal mask?</summary>

- `torch.tril(torch.ones(L, L, dtype=torch.bool))`

- Be explicit whether True=keep or True=mask (APIs differ)

- Broadcast to `[B, H, L, L]` or rely on framework's implicit broadcasting

Flipping the upper/lower triangle; forgetting to align broadcast dimensions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q8. Which axis does the padding mask mask?</summary>

- Usually masks key/value columns (so padding-position probability is 0)

- Shape can be `[B, 1, 1, L_k]` to align with head and query dims

- Note: masking key columns is **not enough** to zero out padded-query outputs; padded query rows are usually handled separately via loss ignore / output zeroing / packed sequences

Thinking the padding mask handles everything — it only prevents "seeing padding", but padded queries' own outputs still need external handling.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q9. Attention complexity?</summary>

- Time $O(B H L_q L_k d_k) = O(B L^2 D)$

- Score memory $O(B H L_q L_k)$

- Long-sequence bottleneck is the quadratic term

Just saying $O(n^2)$ and dropping the head and hidden dims.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q10. Where does attention dropout go?</summary>

- After softmax weights, before the matmul with V

- Enabled only in training, disabled at eval

- After dropout, row sums aren't necessarily 1 (only 1 in expectation)

Demanding row-sum = 1 after dropout as a sanity check (it's wrong).

</details>

### L2 intermediate (research-oriented roles)

<details>

<summary>Q11. Derive the softmax Jacobian by hand.</summary>

- $y_i = \dfrac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}}$

- $\dfrac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} = y_i (\delta_{ij} - y_j)$

- Matrix form: $J = \text{diag}(y) - yy^\top$

Writing only diagonal entries and dropping the cross terms $-y_i y_j$.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q12. What's the pitfall of masking with -∞?</summary>

- Normal case: masked positions get softmax probability 0 ✓

- **Fully-masked row → softmax outputs NaN** ($0/0$)

- Fix path: first avoid all-`-inf` rows (temporarily unmask), zero out that row's weights and output after softmax, and make sure that query doesn't enter the loss / residual accumulation

- Fused kernels / APIs have constraints on sentinel values; under fp16, use a dtype-safe large negative (e.g., `finfo(dtype).min`) for stability

Thinking -inf is always safe; or zeroing only after softmax without preventing NaN.

<summary>Q13. What is the log-sum-exp trick?</summary>

- Subtract max(logits) before softmax — equivalent and preserves probabilities

- Prevents $e^{x_i}$ overflow (fp32 max ≈ 3.4e38, but $e^{100}$ already overflows)

- $\log \sum_j e^{x_j} = m + \log \sum_j e^{x_j - m}$ with $m = \max_j x_j$

Forgetting that $QK^\top$ overflow can happen before softmax (during the matmul accumulation).

<summary>Q14. PyTorch nn.MultiheadAttention's in_proj_weight ordering?</summary>

- Shape `[3D, D]`

- Order: **Q, K, V** (cat dim=0)

- Linear weight is `[out, in]`, so `cat([W_q.weight, W_k.weight, W_v.weight], dim=0)`

Concatenating as K/Q/V or transposing the weight.

<summary>Q15. attn_mask vs key_padding_mask?</summary>

- `attn_mask` controls at the query-key pair level (typically causal)

- `key_padding_mask` controls overall visibility of a key token (typically padding)

- Bool semantics: `nn.MultiheadAttention` uses **True = mask out**; `F.scaled_dot_product_attention`'s bool mask uses **True = keep** (opposite!)

- When using both: under mask-out semantics, combine via **OR** (either True means blocked); under keep semantics, combine via AND (only both True means kept)

Applying True/False without checking API docs; or flipping AND/OR.

<summary>Q16. In cross-attention can L_q and L_k differ?</summary>

- Yes — this is the standard cross-attention case

- Scores shape is $[L_q, L_k]$

- The mask must align with the key dimension

Assuming cross-attn requires equal lengths.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q17. Why do we need the output projection W_o?</summary>

- Fuses outputs from different heads

- Maps back to $d_\text{model}$ for the residual add

- Lets the model learn combinations across heads (not just simple concat)

Thinking the work ends after concat.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q18. Pre-norm vs post-norm impact on the attention block?</summary>

- Pre-norm: `x + Attn(LN(x))`, more stable for deep training, gradient along the residual path is relatively preserved

- Post-norm: `LN(x + Attn(x))`, used in the original Vaswani paper, needs warmup / careful init at extreme depths

- **Most decoder-only LLMs use pre-norm (often with RMSNorm variants)**, but specific architectures have exceptions

Treating norm position as a pure engineering detail; or asserting too absolutely that "all modern LLMs use pre-norm".

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q19. Are attention weights equivalent to "model explanations"?</summary>

- Visualization has reference value (where attention focuses)

- But **not equivalent to causal explanation**

- The value path and subsequent layers change the actual contribution

- Jain & Wallace "Attention is not Explanation" (2019)

Treating high attention weight as "the model's reason" outright.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q20. What to watch in mixed-precision attention?</summary>

- **fp32 accumulation**: matmul accumulation / critical softmax steps in fp32, then cast back to low precision

- **Softmax max-subtraction** (log-sum-exp) to prevent exp overflow — PyTorch's `F.softmax` does this internally

- **Mask sentinel**: under fp16 use `torch.finfo(dtype).min` instead of literal -inf

- **BF16 vs FP16**: BF16's dynamic range is close to fp32, more suitable for attention; fp16 has narrow range and QK^T overflows easily

- **Fused kernels** (FlashAttention, `F.scaled_dot_product_attention`) include kernel-level stabilization and are safer than hand-written naive code

Writing naive attention by hand under FP16 without fp32 accumulation.

<summary>Q21. How does KV cache optimize autoregressive decoding?</summary>

- At decode step $t+1$, compute $Q$ only for the new token (1×D)

- Reuse historical $K, V$ (already in the cache) and append the new $k_{t+1}, v_{t+1}$

- Per-step attention goes from $O(t^2)$ to $O(t)$; whole-sequence generation from $O(L^3)$ to $O(L^2)$

- Per-sample memory: $L_\text{ctx} \cdot n_\text{layers} \cdot 2 \cdot H_\text{kv} \cdot d_\text{head} \cdot \text{bytes}$ (under MQA/GQA, $H_\text{kv} \ll H$)

Saying KV cache reduces training cost — wrong. It only applies to autoregressive inference. Also: cache scales with KV head count, not Q head count.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q22. What do MQA and GQA solve?</summary>

- MQA: multiple Q heads share one set of K/V (K/V has only 1 head)

- GQA: compromise with $G$ K/V groups ($1 < G < H$)

- Main benefit: **decode-time KV-cache memory + memory bandwidth** (large reduction)

- It also reduces K/V projection params and compute (smaller K/V projection matrices), **but does not reduce Q / O projection**

- Quality impact: usually **GQA's quality loss is smaller than MQA's**, depending on model scale and training (LLaMA-2 70B / LLaMA-3 / Mistral / Qwen-2 all use GQA)

Thinking it reduces Q projection; or saying "GQA causes essentially no quality loss" too absolutely.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q23. Core tricks of FlashAttention?</summary>

- **Block tiling**: split $Q, K, V$ into SRAM-sized blocks, load in batches

- **Online softmax**: incrementally maintain running max $m$ and running sum $\ell$, **avoiding materialization** of the full $L \times L$ scores / probs matrix in HBM

- **Recompute on backward**: recompute scores during backward using saved $m, \ell$, no intermediates stored

- Key: **IO-aware exact attention** (mathematically equivalent, not an approximation)

- HBM IO complexity about $O(L^2 d^2 / M + Ld)$ vs $O(L^2 + Ld)$ HBM traffic for standard attention — under long sequences this is a large IO (not FLOPs) reduction

Saying it's approximate attention (like Performer / Linformer) — wrong, FlashAttn is exact; or conflating IO complexity with FLOPs complexity.

</details>

<summary>Q24. RoPE vs ALiBi vs absolute position? What is attention sink?</summary>

- **Absolute**: position vectors added to the input embedding (Vaswani sinusoidal / GPT-2 learned)

- **RoPE**: apply position-dependent rotation to $Q, K$, preserving **relative position** info ($q_m^\top k_n$ depends only on $m-n$)

- **ALiBi**: add a distance bias $-m |i-j|$ to scores, extrapolates naturally

- **Attention sink**: trained LLMs assign abnormally high attention to the first 1-4 tokens (especially [BOS]) even when content-irrelevant — softmax forces sum to 1 so the model needs a "junk slot". StreamingLLM exploits this for long-sequence inference.

Treating attention sink as normal padding / CLS token behavior.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q25. How is attention used in diffusion / latent diffusion?</summary>

- **U-Net latent tokens as Q**, text embedding as K/V, doing **cross-attention** to inject text conditioning

- Self-attention within each spatial resolution (image patches × image patches)

- **CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance)**: two forwards, take difference to amplify the conditional signal

- DiT (Diffusion Transformer): replace U-Net with pure Transformer; conditioning via AdaLN / cross-attn / token-concat

- Video diffusion: combinations of spatial / temporal / spatiotemporal attn (long video is open, $L \sim 10^5$)

Saying diffusion relies only on convolutions; or that attention exists only in DiT (wrong — U-Net has plenty too).
