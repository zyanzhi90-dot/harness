# ARIS Skills Catalog

Every skill that ships with ARIS, grouped by role. **81 skills** as of the
latest update; new skills land via PR and get added to the table below.

- Each `Skill` link goes to the canonical `SKILL.md` (the LLM-readable spec).
- `Role` is a one-line summary — see the `SKILL.md` for the full contract,
  phases, and triggers.
- `Requires` lists external dependencies beyond ARIS core (Codex MCP, Gemini
  API, Modal account, LaTeX toolchain, etc.). `None` means it works out of
  the box on a standard install.

> **Codex CLI mirror:** every skill below has a parallel implementation
> under [`skills/skills-codex/`](../skills/skills-codex/) for Codex CLI users.
> The mirror swaps the Codex-MCP reviewer path for Codex-native
> `spawn_agent` + `send_input`. SKILL semantics are otherwise identical;
> the table below tracks the main-tree canonical files.

## How to use this catalog

- **Looking for a workflow entry point?** Start with [Workflow Orchestrators](#%EF%B8%8F-workflow-orchestrators).
- **Want to add a skill to an existing workflow?** Read the orchestrator's
  `SKILL.md` to see which sub-skills it composes.
- **Building your own pipeline?** Pick the skills from each category and
  chain them via prompt — no framework lock-in, every skill is a single
  `SKILL.md` readable by any LLM agent.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name:` + `description:` frontmatter
   (the description shows up in the LLM's slash-command autocomplete).
2. Per the
   [`integration-contract.md`](../skills/shared-references/integration-contract.md)
   §2 contract, if your skill invokes any helper script under `tools/`, use
   the canonical resolver chain — do NOT hardcode `python3 tools/foo.py`.
3. Add a row to the appropriate category table above (or propose a new
   category in your PR if your skill doesn't fit).
4. The advisory CI lint will catch any hardcoded-path regressions on PR.

See the [main README](../README.md) for installation, setup, and end-to-end
workflow examples.
