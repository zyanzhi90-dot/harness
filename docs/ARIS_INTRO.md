# ARIS — Autonomous Research via Adversarial Multi-Agent Collaboration

> **Let Claude Code do research while you sleep.** Wake up to find your paper scored, weaknesses identified, experiments run, and narrative rewritten — autonomously. Repo: [github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep).

## TL;DR

ARIS is a collection of **80 composable Claude Code skills** that orchestrate **cross-model collaboration**: Claude Code drives the research (reads files, writes code, deploys experiments) while an external LLM (GPT-5.6-Sol via [Codex MCP](https://github.com/openai/codex)) acts as a critical reviewer. The two models disagree, debate, and force each other to do better — adversarial, not self-play.

Seven workflows (W1 / W1.5 / W2 / W3 / W4 / W5 / W6) compose into a full research lifecycle: idea discovery → experiment bridge → auto-review → paper writing → rebuttal → resubmit → conference talk. Tested end-to-end on real ICLR/NeurIPS submissions. Score progression on a real overnight run: **5/10 → 7.5/10 with 20+ GPU experiments**.

> 💡 **The ARIS bet.** Markdown is for writers. HTML is for readers. Every workflow artifact stays in Markdown (auditable, machine-parseable, future-proof). When a human needs to actually *read* one, [`/render-html`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/render-html/SKILL.md) produces this view — gated by a fresh cross-model Codex review (the same ARIS invariant every other audit-class skill follows).

## The Problem

Every ML researcher reading this knows the rhythm:

1. Spend 3 weeks reading 80 papers.
2. Brainstorm 12 ideas, kill 9 in your head, fail to validate the remaining 3 quickly.
3. Pick one, lose a week to a bug, miss the GPU window.
4. Submit, get a 5/10 review with "lacks ablation against XYZ".
5. Rebuttal week is 72 hours; you have 2 days of teaching duty.

The bottleneck isn't ideas. It's the **end-to-end orchestration** between literature → ideation → experiments → writing → rebuttal. AI can compress every individual step, but the integration is fragile — and worse, a single model reviewing its own work falls into local minima.

> 🚨 **Why not self-play with one model?** Using Claude Code subagents (or any homogeneous agent team) for both *execution* and *review* tends to fall into local minima — the same model reviewing its own patterns creates blind spots. ARIS forces cross-family disagreement: Claude executes, GPT reviews. They don't share lineage, they don't share training data, they don't share blind spots.

---

## Core Architecture

The system is, in one sentence:

$$
\text{Research} = \arg\max_{\theta}\; \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{ideas}}}\bigl[\, U_{\text{exec}}(\theta\,;\,x) - \lambda \cdot R_{\text{review}}(\theta\,;\,x) \,\bigr]
$$

where $U_{\text{exec}}$ is the utility of an executor model writing code / running experiments, and $R_{\text{review}}$ is an *adversarial regularizer* from a cross-family reviewer that penalizes overclaims, fabricated citations, unjustified theorem extensions, and self-flattery. The regularizer is **non-differentiable** — it's a fresh LLM thread reading the artifact cold.

### The reviewer-independence protocol

Every review round uses a **fresh codex thread**. We never use `codex-reply` to continue a previous review conversation. This is a hard rule, learned from a real NeurIPS run where `codex-reply` chains inflated scores from 3/10 → 8/10 through narrative accumulation (the reviewer started defending its earlier criticism instead of evaluating the current artifact). The protocol is codified at [`skills/shared-references/reviewer-independence.md`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/shared-references/reviewer-independence.md).

```

> 🔒 **Cross-family invariant.** The executor and reviewer **must** be different model families (Claude × GPT, GLM × DeepSeek, Antigravity × Gemini, …). Same-family review is a non-feature; if you only have one provider, the cheapest fix is to add a free DeepSeek or Gemini reviewer via [`llm-chat` MCP](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/tree/main/mcp-servers/llm-chat).

## The Workflows

| W | Name | One-line summary | Entry point |
|:--:|------|------------------|-------------|
| **1** | Idea Discovery | Literature → brainstorm 8-12 → novelty check → pilot 2-3 on GPU → ranked report | [`/idea-discovery`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/idea-discovery/SKILL.md) |

| **6** | Conference Talk | Paper → Beamer + PPTX + speaker notes + assurance audits | [`/paper-talk`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-talk/SKILL.md) |

### Workflow 1 — Idea Discovery & Method Refinement

> **"I have a research direction. What should I actually work on?"**

[`/idea-discovery`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/idea-discovery/SKILL.md) takes a vague research direction and outputs a ranked, pilot-validated proposal:

1. 📚 **Survey** — multi-source literature search (Zotero / Obsidian / arXiv / Semantic Scholar / DeepXiv / Exa) builds a landscape map
2. 🧠 **Brainstorm** — GPT-5.6-Sol xhigh generates 8-12 concrete ideas anchored to identified gaps
3. 🔍 **Novelty check** — each top idea cross-checked against arXiv + DBLP for prior work; failed ideas killed early
4. 🧪 **Pilot** — 2-3 surviving ideas get 1-2-hour single-GPU pilot runs (a real signal, not just LLM opinion)
5. 🏆 **Refine** — top pilot result fed to [`/research-refine`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/research-refine/SKILL.md) which anchors the problem, tightens the method, and emits an experiment plan ready for Workflow 1.5

```bash
/idea-discovery "factorized gap in discrete diffusion LMs" \
    --- effort: max \
    --- sources: zotero, web, deepxiv
```

> 💡 **The bet here**: a 1-hour GPU pilot tells you more than 1 hour of LLM-only reasoning. Failed pilots also get written to [Research Wiki](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/research-wiki/SKILL.md) so they become anti-repetition memory.

---

### Workflow 1.5 — Experiment Bridge

> **"I have a plan. Make it run."**

[`/experiment-bridge`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/experiment-bridge/SKILL.md) closes the gap between paper plan and running code:

1. 📋 **Read** `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` (from W1 or hand-written)
2. 💻 **Implement** experiment scripts — reuses your existing codebase, adds `argparse` / `logging` / seeds where missing
3. 🔬 **GPT-5.6-Sol code review** — fresh-thread cross-model review of the generated code BEFORE any GPU time is spent (catches ~80% of bugs that would otherwise burn 8-GPU-hour runs)
4. ✅ **Sanity check** — smallest config runs first; checks for OOM, NaN, runtime errors
5. 🚀 **Deploy** — SSH to your GPU server (per `CLAUDE.md`), launch in `screen`, capture stdout/stderr
6. 📊 **Collect** — `/monitor-experiment` polls until completion, fetches results, formats for downstream skills

```bash
/experiment-bridge --- base repo: https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/some-baseline
```

> 🔒 **Hard rule**: code review is *cross-model* (Claude wrote it, GPT reviews it). Same-family review on your own code is a non-feature — the model that wrote a bug usually can't see it.

---

### Workflow 2 — Auto Review Loop

> **"Review my paper, fix what's wrong, repeat until it passes."**

[`/auto-review-loop`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/auto-review-loop/SKILL.md) is the most-cited workflow. Run it the night before a deadline; wake up to a polished paper.

1. 🔍 **Deep review** — GPT-5.6-Sol xhigh reviews the paper, identifies weaknesses (severity tagged)
2. 🩹 **Fix** — Claude implements the fixes (rewrite, add baselines, run experiments); skips any experiment > 4 GPU-hours, flags for manual follow-up
3. 📊 **Re-evaluate** — collect results, update paper, feed back to the reviewer (fresh thread)
4. 🔁 **Repeat** — until score ≥ `POSITIVE_THRESHOLD` (default 6/10) or `MAX_ROUNDS` (default 4); if the context window fills mid-loop, auto-resume from `REVIEW_STATE.json`

```bash
/auto-review-loop "focus on Section 3-5, our CRF results are weak" \
    --- difficulty: nightmare \
    --- effort: max
```

The `difficulty: nightmare` flag lets GPT-5.6-Sol read your repo directly via `codex exec` — Claude can't filter what it sees. Maximum stress test before submission.

<details>
<summary><b>Key safety features (click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🔒 **`MAX_ROUNDS = 4`** — prevents infinite loops; stops early if score threshold is met
- ⏱️ **> 4 GPU-hour experiments skipped** — flagged for manual follow-up, never silently launched
- 🧠 **Prefer reframing over new experiments** — when both can address a weakness, picks the cheaper path
- 🪞 **No hiding weaknesses** — explicit rule: "Do NOT hide weaknesses to game a positive score"
- 🔧 **Fix before re-review** — must implement fixes before resubmitting; no empty promises
- 💾 **Compact recovery** — persists `REVIEW_STATE.json` each round; auto-resumes if context window fills

</details>

> 🔁 **Why this workflow is the headline**: it's the only one that runs *autonomously overnight* — the human signs off before bed, the system reviews + fixes + re-runs experiments + re-reviews until the threshold is hit, and writes a one-paragraph summary of what changed. Empirically the most-cited path; the real-results table above is from one of these runs.

---

### Workflow 3 — Paper Writing Pipeline

> **"I have results. Turn them into a submission-ready PDF."**

[`/paper-writing`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-writing/SKILL.md) takes a `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` (claims, experiments, key figures) and produces compiled LaTeX:

1. 📐 **Plan** — [`/paper-plan`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-plan/SKILL.md) builds a claims-evidence matrix from the narrative, then a section-by-section outline
2. 📊 **Figures** — [`/paper-figure`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-figure/SKILL.md) auto-generates plots (line / bar / heatmap) and comparison tables from JSON/CSV results. Architecture diagrams via [`/figure-spec`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/figure-spec/SKILL.md) (deterministic JSON → SVG) or Gemini illustration
3. ✍️ **Write** — [`/paper-write`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-write/SKILL.md) emits per-section LaTeX following the venue's style file. Citations pulled from DBLP / CrossRef (real BibTeX, never LLM-generated)
4. 🔧 **Compile** — [`/paper-compile`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-compile/SKILL.md) runs `latexmk` until clean, fixes overfull `\hbox`, verifies the page limit via `pdftotext`
5. ✨ **Polish** — [`/auto-paper-improvement-loop`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/auto-paper-improvement-loop/SKILL.md) runs 2 rounds of GPT-5.6-Sol content review + 1 round of format check. Real ICLR run: **4/10 → 8.5/10 across 3 rounds**

```bash
/paper-writing NARRATIVE_REPORT.md --- venue: ICLR --- effort: max
```

> ✅ **Submission gate**: at `effort: max` / `effort: beast` (or explicit `assurance: submission`), the PDF is only labelled "submission-ready" if [`/proof-checker`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/proof-checker/SKILL.md), [`/paper-claim-audit`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-claim-audit/SKILL.md), and [`/citation-audit`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/citation-audit/SKILL.md) all return green via `tools/verify_paper_audits.sh`.

---

### Workflow 4 — Rebuttal

> **"Reviews came back. Help me draft a safe rebuttal."**

[`/rebuttal`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/rebuttal/SKILL.md) is structured around three hard safety gates that block fabrication:

1. 📥 **Parse** reviews — atomize into per-reviewer / per-concern entries; normalize against the venue's format (ICML char limit, NeurIPS per-reviewer threads, etc.)
2. 🗺️ **Strategy** — global themes + per-reviewer priority + character budget + a list of blocked claims (things the reviewer flagged but the paper can't actually back)
3. 🧪 **Evidence sprint** (optional) — if `--- auto experiment: true` and the reviewer asked for a missing experiment, hand off to `/experiment-bridge`, wait for results, fold into draft
4. ✍️ **Draft** — global opener + numbered per-reviewer responses + closing for the meta-reviewer
5. 🛡️ **Safety check** — 6 lints: coverage (no concern dropped), provenance (every claim cites paper/review/user-confirmed result), commitment (no overpromising), tone, internal consistency, character limit
6. 🔬 **GPT-5.6-Sol stress test** — fresh-thread reviewer reads the draft cold, tries to break it
7. 📤 **Finalize** — two outputs: `PASTE_READY.txt` (exact character count, ready to drop into OpenReview) + `REBUTTAL_DRAFT_rich.md` (extended, for human editing)

```bash
/rebuttal "paper/ + reviews" --- venue: ICML --- character limit: 5000
```

> 🔒 **Three safety gates — rebuttal will NOT finalize if any fails**: (a) **provenance** — every claim maps to paper/review/user-confirmed result; (b) **commitment** — every promise is user-approved; (c) **coverage** — every reviewer concern is tracked through to a response.

---

### Workflow 5 — Resubmit Pipeline

> **"Move a polished paper from venue A to venue B under hard constraints."**

[`/resubmit-pipeline`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/resubmit-pipeline/SKILL.md) is for the ICML→NeurIPS / workshop→archival transition. Distinct from Workflow 3 (which writes from scratch) — here the paper exists, the goal is targeted edits only:

1. 📁 **Physical isolation** — copy into `<NEW_VENUE_DIR>/`; the original submission directory is *never touched*
2. 🛡️ **5-layer anonymity check** — author names, affiliations, self-citations, GitHub / Overleaf URLs, in-text "we" patterns that break double-blind
3. 🔬 **Soft-only audits** — `/proof-checker`, `/paper-claim-audit`, `/citation-audit --soft-only` (the `--soft-only` mode rewrites instead of editing bib, since the bib is frozen)
4. ✏️ **Microedit** — [`/auto-paper-improvement-loop --edit-whitelist`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/auto-paper-improvement-loop/SKILL.md) with a YAML schema (`allowed_paths` / `forbidden_paths` / `forbidden_operations`)
5. 🗡 **Adversarial gate** — [`/kill-argument`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/kill-argument/SKILL.md) writes the strongest 200-word rejection memo a senior area chair would write; an independent adjudicator scores each point
6. 📤 **Compile + push** — `/paper-compile` + optional `/overleaf-sync push`

```bash
/resubmit-pipeline "paper/" --- venue: NeurIPS
```

> 🔒 **Hard constraints (cannot be overridden)**: no new experiments, no bib edits, no framework changes, never overwrites prior submissions. Microedit YAML schema enforces these at every diff.

---

### Workflow 6 — Conference Talk Pipeline

> **"Paper accepted. Prepare the talk."**

[`/paper-talk`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-talk/SKILL.md) is the post-acceptance sister workflow to `/paper-writing`:

1. 📋 **Outline** — extracted from `paper/` (or `NARRATIVE_REPORT.md` if no compiled paper); one slide-cluster per contribution; section→talk-beat mapping
2. 🎨 **Generate** — [`/paper-slides`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-slides/SKILL.md) emits Beamer source + PPTX + speaker notes + Q&A prep
3. 💎 **Polish** — [`/slides-polish`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/slides-polish/SKILL.md) does per-page Codex review against the reference PDF; applies a fix-pattern catalog (PPTX font scaling 1.5-1.8× for projector legibility, banner-as-tcolorbox, em-dash spacing, Chinese EA font hint via PingFang SC, anonymity placeholder discipline)
4. 🛡️ **Audit** (when `assurance: conference-ready`) — `/paper-claim-audit` + `/citation-audit` run against a synthetic paper directory at `.aris/paper-talk/audit-input/sections/*.tex` to verify slides don't introduce claims the paper can't back

```bash
/paper-talk "paper/" --- venue: ICLR --- assurance: conference-ready
```

> 💡 **Assurance ladder** (independent of `effort`): `draft` / `polished` (default) / `conference-ready`. Legal combination: `--- effort: lite --- assurance: conference-ready` = "fast pipeline, every audit must emit a verdict before the final report." Use it when you trust the writing pass but want hard claim/citation gates.

---

### Cross-cutting: Research Wiki & Meta-Optimize

Two skills that aren't bound to any single workflow but make the whole system smarter over time:

- 📚 **[`/research-wiki`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/research-wiki/SKILL.md)** — persistent knowledge base across all seven workflows. Stores every paper read, idea piloted (including failures), experiment run, claim verified. Failed ideas become anti-repetition memory: the next time `/idea-creator` runs, it sees what didn't work and steers around it.

- 🧬 **[`/meta-optimize`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/meta-optimize/SKILL.md)** — the outer-loop SKILL.md optimizer. Reads accumulated event logs from your past runs (`.aris/meta/events.jsonl`), analyzes patterns (which skills failed often? which parameter overrides were common? where did scores plateau?), and proposes SKILL.md improvements. Reviewer-gated, user-approved.

---

## Real Results

A real overnight 4-round run on an ML research project, from borderline reject to submission-ready:

| Round | Score | Key change |
|------:|:-----:|------------|
|   0   | 5/10  | Baseline narrative + figures |
|   1   | 6.5/10 | Fixed assumption-model mismatch, softened claims |
|   2   | 6.8/10 | Added synthetic validation; tightened limitations |
|   3   | 7.0/10 | Theorem self-contained; renamed conflicting notation |
|   4   | **7.5/10** | Format pass; passed page check; ICLR-compliant |

**Final**: 8 pages main body (ICLR limit: 9), 0 overfull `\hbox`, ICLR-compliant. **+2.5 points across 4 rounds.**

> ✅ **Reproducibility caveat.** Score values from GPT-5.6-Sol are *signals*, not ground truth. ARIS iterates against them, so high AI-review scores are an expected outcome of the loop, not independent proof of acceptance. Human reviewers still bring updated literature knowledge and venue taste an AI reviewer doesn't model.

### The 3-layer audit chain

A core ARIS invariant: **the executor must not judge its own integrity**. Three layers of cross-model audit:

| Layer | Skill | Asks | When |
|:----:|-------|------|------|
| 1 | [`/experiment-audit`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/experiment-audit/SKILL.md) | "Is the eval code honest? (no fake GT, no self-normalized scores, no phantom results)" | Before / after experiment runs |
| 2 | [`/result-to-claim`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/result-to-claim/SKILL.md) | "Does the claim scientifically follow from the result?" | After results, before writing |
| 3 | [`/paper-claim-audit`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/paper-claim-audit/SKILL.md) | "Does the paper *report* the numbers truthfully?" (fresh zero-context reviewer) | Before submission |

Plus [`/citation-audit`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/citation-audit/SKILL.md) (4th layer): every `\cite{...}` validated for existence, metadata, **and** context-appropriateness — the most diagnostic check ("does the cited paper actually establish this claim?"). And [`/kill-argument`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/kill-argument/SKILL.md) (5th layer): two fresh codex gpt-5.6-sol + ultra threads write the strongest 200-word rejection memo and an independent adjudicator pass before submission.

## Cross-platform Support

ARIS skills are plain `SKILL.md` files. They run anywhere an agent reads markdown:

- 🤖 **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — the default, most tested
- 🤖 **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/tree/main/skills/skills-codex)** — full skill mirror; `spawn_agent` instead of `mcp__codex__codex` (base pack's default reviewer is same-family — install a claude-review/gemini-review overlay for cross-family verdicts)
- 🖱️ **[Cursor](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/docs/CURSOR_ADAPTATION.md)** — agent mode reads ARIS skills directly
- 🖥️ **[Trae](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/docs/TRAE_ARIS_RUNBOOK_EN.md)** — ByteDance AI IDE
- 🚀 **[Antigravity](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/docs/ANTIGRAVITY_ADAPTATION.md)** — Google's agent-first IDE, native SKILL.md
- 🐙 **[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/docs/COPILOT_CLI_ADAPTATION.md)** — terminal agent, native SKILL.md
- 🐾 **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/docs/OPENCLAW_ADAPTATION.md)** — without Claude Code slash skills

> 📝 **ARIS is a methodology, not a platform.** Fork it, rewrite it, adapt it to your stack. The only invariants are: cross-family review, fresh threads for reviewers, audit integrity. Everything else — model choice, install path, integration surface — is yours.

## 中文版速览

ARIS（**A**utonomous **R**esearch via Adversarial **M**ulti-Agent Collaboration，**梦中科研**）是一组 80 个可组合的 Claude Code skills，编排**跨模型对抗式协作**：

- **执行**：Claude Code 读文件、写代码、跑实验、改论文
- **审稿**：GPT-5.6-Sol（via [Codex MCP](https://github.com/openai/codex)）以**跨家族**审稿人身份打分、找弱点、提建议
- **关键**：每轮 review 用新 thread；执行者绝不审判自己的实验诚实度

七条工作流（W1 / W1.5 / W2 / W3 / W4 / W5 / W6）端到端贯通：找 idea → 实验桥接 → 自动审稿循环 → 写论文 → 写 rebuttal → 跨 venue 移植 → 会议演讲。在真实 ICLR/NeurIPS 投稿上验证过。

> 🆕 **新加入的 skill**：[`/render-html`](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep/blob/main/skills/render-html/SKILL.md) —— 把任何 ARIS 产出的 MD（如 `IDEA_REPORT.md`、`AUTO_REVIEW.md`、`KILL_ARGUMENT.md`）渲染成单文件 HTML，适合给人类读。Markdown 仍是 canonical source，HTML 是 generated view，永远嵌入源 SHA256 + 渲染时间戳防 drift。**academic 模板默认走跨模型 Codex review gate**——同样的 ARIS 不变量。

## Get Started

```bash
# 1. Clone ARIS to a stable location (once)
git clone https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep.git ~/aris_repo

# 2. Attach to a project (creates project-local symlinks)
cd ~/your-paper-project
bash ~/aris_repo/tools/install_aris.sh

# 3. Configure the GPT-5.6-Sol reviewer (Codex MCP)
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex setup                                    # pick gpt-5.6-sol when asked
claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server

# 4. Use in Claude Code
claude
> /research-pipeline "factorized gap in discrete diffusion LMs"
```

> ⚙️ **Alternative model combinations** — no Claude or OpenAI API required. See the [Alt routes](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep#-alternative-model-combinations) (Alt B/E for GLM × MiniMax-M3 or free DeepSeek-V3.1 via ModelScope; nine routes total, including Antigravity-as-executor and Gemini-direct-API-as-reviewer).
